Can't you see it?
Bad dog, but for you I'm obedient
Trash Star, cross my heart, that's the reason
Look up at the stars, they're retreating
Don't get lost, don't live what I'm preaching
Drain Jesus, ice me immediately
Can't even come home when it's freezing
925, bury me my medallion
Smell like spray paint, yeah, what I'm off of
Link at the gas stop, won't stop, I can't stop
Can't even see clear, where I'm at though
This not a mansion, it's a castle
You a fuckboy, I heard it from Ecco
Drain Show, no face, came through the back door
We can't even bring no girls in my section
Feel like OD9, I'm a dragon
Can't even talk to myself 'cause I'm wrong now
White gate calling me, won't be long now
I can't even put those words in my songs now
Big strong compounds, life force get crossed out
Siren calling, ambulance sound
Drain Gang track you down like a Bloodhound
I can't even trust myself when the night comes
Four doors, red or blue, pick the right one
It's some writing on the wall, it said "Die scum"
No heart, but I do wish I had one
And my baby wanna know what I'm scared of
Don't worry, it's been taken care of
Bladee, I'm coming for the trash like a trashman
Hell Gang, put that back in the trash can
I can't even trust myself when the night comes
Step on my head twice like a cockroach
Every time I close my eyes, I stop existing
Every now and again, I can tell the difference
Woke up falling, I'm still falling off of buildings
Want a new addiction, want to fall victim
Something you might crush my heart but I'ma risk it
And I’m still sinking, need a curse lifted
Blacklisted at all the clubs, but I can fix this
Think I need stitches, pray to three sixes
I wanna see heads roll, execute past life
Hundred white birds, ninety-nine fall out the sky
Fast life, race against time, it will outrun you
Rains return to the earth, sunlight to the underworld
Maybe in another life we could be lovers
Ever since we met, these thoughts keep getting worse
Iron will, ironed shirt, now I want a Fendi purse
I don't talk with empty words, what is any of it worth?
Every time I close my eyes, I go to prison
Every now and again, I can feel the distance
Woke up running, I'm still running through the system
Want a new sickness, want to fall victim
Somewhere, someone broke your heart but I'ma fix it
And I'm still wishing for that first kiss, get
Blacklisted at all the clubs in Seven Sisters
Industry children play with three sixes
Every time I close my eyes, I stop existingDrain Gang forever
So guess what
What? I don't know
Take a knife and drain your life
If it's a depot, gotta bite it
If I see weed, I gotta light it
If I get feelings, gotta hide it
If it's illegal, I don't mind it
I broke my wrist, I gotta ice it
I wanna see you be my sidekick
If I post pics, you gotta like it
If you do this then you're the nicest
To be honest, if it's wrong, I don't want to be right
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
To be honest, if it's wrong, I don't want to be right
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
Talk to me nice, talk to me nice
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
Talk to me nice, talk to me nice
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
Two strike is nothing, I three-strike it
Can't name the feeling, man, that I get
All this shit, I'm goin' through a crisis
If you do this for me, you're the nicest
You're the nicest, my sleeve pull surprises
How many times I prayed? I pray three, I'm not anxious
Gotta play the game and it's free but not painless
I slide D&G, Silver Link, fuck a razor
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

I hear voices, I hear voices when I'm by myself
No sex with you but I think that you should fuck yourself
Ice cream baby, leave you in the sun and let you melt
Life or death, what is the difference? I guess I can't tell
Go through hell, I'll make a situation for myself
Go to hell, I'll make a situation for myself
Three vacs on the pack, but you still feel the smell
Watch me baby, I come for you, climbing out the well
I was almost at the top but I looked down and fell
Come and shop with me, mom and dad's money
Please stop tagging me, it looks bad on me
Got a band with me, we can have a party
Me and bro look clean, plastic surgery
They wanna be like me, it's emergency
She say I'm crazy and you worry me
Please stop hurting me, I need surgery
Need a Burberry for my lil' fairy
How could I be so naive?
I can't believe I'm catching feelings
Freezin', I can't feel my teeth
Got snowflakes all over my keys
I'm bleedin' from my nose
My heart is beating too fast
Shallow breathing
See you, baby, you need to leave
No seatbelt, duck into a Prius
You're my missing piece, will you keep my secrets?
I was never evil but I'll be a demon for you
Fly Norwegian to Berlin on weekends
Then go back to Sweden
Please don't break my heart
I promise I'll never get attached to people
Six in the morning and I'm thinkin' I should end myself
3 P.M. and I'm thinking I should get some help
Woke up feeling like, feeling like I'm not myself

Need a Burberry for my lil' fairyShe like me but she think that I'm a weirdo
Me and Nino smokin' out the kilo
I'm a fiend, bro, I'm calling for a black crow
I lost my backbone, don't wanna get it back though
A lot of black smoke falling from the Lambo
On the West Coast it's just me and Ecco
You're holding on to a shadow, gotta let go
Headshot me, I'm swallowed by a black hole
Trash star king, smoke and dirty mirrors
Storm's comin', I feel it in my fingers
Puppet king, they dance, Cinderella
Your glass shoe don't fit, we gon' steal 'em
Who comes out at night? It's a riddle
This not a Oxy', it's a Skittle
Drain Gang boys creepin' in the gutter
This not LSD, it's a puzzle
These are not diamonds, frozen water
Hope you hate my shit 'cause you're garbage
I am home alone in my castle
Life was aight, I don't wanna know what's after
Blood on blood
I'll bring your end
Love your love
Blood on blood
I'll bring your end
All I wanna see is ten-eighty Gs
I'm GTB 'til I RIP
I gotta leave for a couple weeks
Day three, losin' beauty sleep
I-I-I will get it for you, whatever you need
Crushing ecstasy in between my teeth
It's not speed, need a set of keys
I am D&G, drinkin' antifreeze
And my feet don't touch the street
It's not that deep, I don't talk to creeps
Feel like sixteen but I'm not that sweet
She had a crush on me, may she rest in peace
I got the leaks
It's not that deep, I don't talk to creeps
Feel like sixteen but I'm not that sweet
She had a crush on me, may she rest in peaceI'm gonna bleed in the club, I got weed in my lungs
I don't need any love, I can't feel when I'm drunk
I can't breathe, I can't trust, I cannot get enough
Watch my dreams getting crushed, turn my dreams into dust
Cold outside and I don't know what to wear
If you go right now, I don't know if I would care
I don't get scared, but I get nightmares
What's the point of anything if you can't share?
I love cold winds 'cause it tells me where to go
I can't look back, and I cannot lose control
Find yourself, find yourself
I'm gonna bleed in the club, I got weed in my lungs
I don't need any love, I can't feel when I'm drunk
I can't breathe, I can't trust, I cannot get enough
Watch my dreams getting crushed, turn my dreams into dust
Lost my speed, now I'm slowing down
I can't believe that I'm lonely now
One hundred keys and they owe me now
I cannot feel anything inside
I couldn't breathe when you told me why
I want to sleep, I don't want to die
Admit defeat, give away the crown
If we don't speak, you can't let me downI will tell you the truth
I wanna take your youth
I wanna drink from you
Your blood tastes so sweet
Like sugar, baby
Like sugar, baby
Demons say "I deserve your DNA"
Be awake, forever for you, I wait
It's okay, it's okay, to go away
It might take a life to pay, pay it with the razor blade
Tell me what you want to say
I can't take the truth today, so tell me a fairy tale
Heaven say, "I'm on my way"
I don't care what Heaven say, I'm waiting for your embrace
You don't want me, do you?
You don't want me, do you?
Know what I'll do to you
Wish I never knew you
I wonder what you do
When I'm gone
Your blood tastes so sweet
Like sugar, baby
Like sugar, baby
Your blood tastes so sweet
Like sugar, baby
Like sugar, babyWho goes there? It's the ghost of October
Summer's over, now I'm goin' nowhere
Who holds her? It's not me, I'm a loner
But I don't wanna go-go-go there
You're sober, that's not me, I'm a stoner
I prefer it when the world moves slower
Who goes there? It's just me and my soldiers
I come from the snow, it's cold-cold-colder
It's bad, it's bad
You don't know what I am, I'm a sick man
And this world feels so distant
But today I'm feelin' so indifferent
Every Friday's Halloween
My week is a dream, I'm just walkin' in my sleep
By any means I'll be lowkey
I'm gonna need a reason to be seen
All the prayer is for nothing
No touching, I find it disgusting
Flyin' in my lane with my cousin
Why they bugging? I don't do discussion
I'm on an airplane to London
They want something from me all of a sudden
I come up when I'm summoned
I heard everything was gonna change but it worsened
Who goes there? It's the ghost of October
Summer's over, now I'm going nowhere
Who holds her? It's not me, I'm a loner
But I don't wanna go-go-go there
You're sober, that's not me, I'm a stoner
I prefer it when the world moves slower
Who goes there? It's just me and my soldiers
I come from the snow, it's cold-cold-colder
Who goes there? It's the ghost of October
Summer's over, now I'm going nowhere
Who holds her? It's not me, I'm a loner
But I don't wanna go-go-go there
You're sober, that's not me, I'm a stoner
I prefer it when the world moves slower
Who goes there? It's just me and my soldiers
I come from the snow, it's cold-cold-colderIn the sewer all alone, that's my home
Can't pay you anything right now, give you a loan
Don't know you, you're not my bro, where you from?
Change my face, I grow my hair, need a comb
Slowly lose to decay, lost my hope
Drain Gang and you can't hang with us, need a rope
They're still talking about my name, they're on coke
Trashman, I waste my days in the smoke
I fell off in the night
Bring back Thaiboy, I say it twice
Bring myself up to the light
Yeah, bitch, you know I'm high
Blood moon forge a contract when it's signed
Blood pact I wrote you, baby, with a knife
Trash Star, I eat the night, I do it twice
Backstab you out of nowhere, you're surprised
Backstab you out of nowhere, you're surprised
Goddamn, you ain't on shit, why you so hyped?
Goddamn, I wonder, why am I alive?
I give myself up to the red light
I give myself up to the red light
I give myself up to the red light
In-in-in the sewer-sewer all alone, that's my home
Can't pay you anything right now, give you a loan
Don't know you, you're not my bro, where you from?
Change my face, I grow my hair, need a comb
Slowly lose to decay, lost my hope
Drain Gang and you can't hang with us, need a rope
They're still talking about my name, they're on coke
Trashman, I waste my days in the smokePut a pill in a McFlurry, I'm goofy
Shoot me, acting for the cameras, it's a movie
I can see you're gloomy, 'cause I'm too T'd
I'm a dog on the roof like Snoopy
Sue me, hate me 'cause you're not me
I'm a white boy, 30 in my khakis
In the Uber and I sleep, fuck a car key
Love the smell of gasoline, bleach and sharpies
I was on Miami beach on a dark street
I wake up with sweaty sheets, sometimes it's deep
I'ma smoke a pound of weed if I can't sleep
If you can't sleep, you should call me
I'm in Stockholm for a week, I move discreet
Acting crazy off the coke, you can get beat
I make money off of songs, so it came free
So it goes free, put it on me
I don't wanna fight, nothing to talk about, walk it out
If you mad, don't wanna talk it out with you, Mickey Mouse
I'm inside the mansion, can't get out, get your feelings out
Gatekeeper, lock you out, Rainworld, we lock it down
MIA, I'm missing, can't be found, that's without a doubt
Do it for the money like a clown, watch me falling down
Swimming in the deep end, you might drown, I'ma bleed the crown
I can't feel the ground when I walk around
I'ma take a moment for my mind, we used to be tight
I go even deeper in the night, I'ma read my rights
I don't wanna open what you write, in another life
I get in my feelings like a knife, my heart's bleeding out
I have tears inside and I don't even know how to cry
But it's giving me a drive, I just go on with my life
Tell me why you do me like you do, you don't need to lie
I'ma paint a smile, it's a disguise, I finesse you twice
High five me, three strike me, you like me? That's funny
I'm worried 'bout money, not about you, you're ugly
You're old news, that's dusty, I'm edgy, don't push me
I hang with some junkies, I'm shady, don't trust me
I don't wanna fight, nothing to talk about, walk it out
If you mad, don't wanna talk it out with you, Mickey Mouse
I'm inside the mansion, can't get out, get your feelings out
Gatekeeper, lock you out, Rainworld, we lock it down
MIA, I'm missing, can't be found, that's without a doubt
Do it for the money like a clown, watch me falling down
Swimming in the deep end, you might drown, I'ma bleed the crown
I can't feel the ground when I walk around
I'm bleeding outI'm drinking bleach on the beach, make my teeth white
The darkness is too dark, so I need light
All white armor, looks like daylight
Put the blade to your throat if you don't need life
Blue jeans, two stacks, and they're bleached out
In the car, windows down, don't make me reach out
She said never again, but we speak now
Black heart, black soul, but it's bleached now
Bleached denim, bleached hair
GTB, we don't need air
I don't breathe air, we are smoking weed here
The pack smell like bleach, we don't smoke 'em seeds here
No dirt on my feet, there's no streets here
Marble floor in my house, I'm a cleaner
You can't get inside the gate, got a keeper
Bladee is a leader, pour bleach on my sneakers
I can bleach the darkness out your mind
White powder, white pills, leave your body behind
Sub-zero ice camouflage, leave you snow blind
Spending Bitcoins online, power up in no time
We the future of the frozen city, dressed in bright white
Coming for the cold winter, stay for the nightlife
If you don't dress right, you ain't my type
Albino Alligators finna blow up my spot tonight
I feel nothing, lean without the Robitussin
Catch me smoking White Widow, sipping on a White Russian
Keep me bleached out, buzzing, for your own sake
She said bring me home and give it to me 'til my bones breakSomeone free me from my skin
Evaporated, now I'm gone in the wind
Something ended, but nothing new did begin
I carry weight until my spine's giving in
My words, they didn't mean a thing
I was just trying to get in
You're looking for someone, but I'm not him
What do you want from me? I'm just wondering
Hating on the kid, but I don't want to live
I don't have anything to give to you
I stay with the crew
And we don't need anything from you
I've been to Hell and back for twenty stacks
I keep on going 'til my visions black
I'm lost and I'm not going back
And I got a pack, leave me, I don't wanna match
It's funny how they wanna act
X-Ray Gucci shades so I can see through that
Cut you in your throat and make you free at last
And they stalk me when I'm out, I gotta wear a mask
She gave me a lovenote
But I woke up with a cut throat
I can't let you come close
I'm the one your god chose, I stay in the condos
She gave me a lovenote
But I woke up with a cut throat
I can't let you come close
I'm the one your god chose, I stay in the condos
I will change for you, can I see you soon?
I've stayed up so many moons
I've been waiting for you, I don't know what to do
I want the darkness to take over for me too
But the pain be true, take it away from you
You disrespect SG then they gon' sentence you
I'm with the Drain, it's true, thinkin' 'bout draining you
Blood dripping on my Margiela shoes
She gave me a lovenote
But I woke up with a cut throat
I can't let you come close
I'm the one your god chose, I stay in the condos
She gave me a lovenote
But I woke up with a cut throat
I can't let you come close
I'm the one your god chose, I stay in the condosChainsaw on your throat, all the words come out
Cocaine in my throat and my nose dripped down
Going with the flow, with the wind, go out
Comin' from the dark with my scars, no sound
I be in the park off a pill, so what?
You did this a year, but for me, for life
Drain Gang CEO, I'm the ice king now
I don't give a fuck, on my way back down
I'll survive a snake bite
I live in the late night
I can see the hate rise
Smokin' on the gray skies
I went to hell eight times
Now I got a sick mind
I know that you want mine
Heard it through the grapevine
I don't know your star sign
I been goin' snowblind
I don't need to slow down
Put me in a ghost shrine
I am going rogue now
Ziploc for the low down
Codeine in my blood, fam
Shouts out to the Shield Gang
Chainsaw on your throat, all the words come out
Cocaine in my throat and my nose dripped down
Going with the flow, with the wind, go out
Comin' from the dark with my scars, no sound
I be in the park off a pill, so what?
You did this a year, but for me, for life
Drain Gang CEO, I'm the ice king now
I don't give a fuck, on my way back down
Don't know how to show love
Please don't get your hopes up
You might get your soul crushed
Closed up like a rosebud
I just got my throat cut
Hope I don't get cold blood
Now I'm goin' ghost, feel like Phantom of the Opera
Shiftin' my persona
Codeine in my soda
Slipped into a coma
Wish I never woke up
Ever since we sold out
People say they know us
Margiela loafers but I know he's a poser
Chainsaw on your throat, all the words come out
Cocaine in my throat and my nose dripped down
Going with the flow, with the wind, go out
Comin' from the dark with my scars, no sound
I be in the park off a pill, so what?
You did this a year, but for me, for life
Drain Gang CEO, I'm the ice king now
I don't give a fuck on my way back downDrain Gang
Take a knife and drain your life

Drinking liquid acid out of plastic cups, Jurassic boy
Watch on my wrist, it's all black but it's made of gold
Raining gold, I'll break your soul, my mind is using mind control
In a gold mine with an axe and a superstone
Gucci phone, Coca Cola snow, sending super drones
From the iron throne, put you down like a skeleton
In my bones, silver herringbone like the thunder dome
When I woke up one day, everything was gone
Olders don't know how to rap, ya know I'm strapped up
Lean’s all around me, I been I been really sippin'
I see dead people, I'm really trippin'
Take 'em to the back and get the snappin'

I came out of the ice storm
This blood sword is my light source
At the white shores when the night falls
Was my life form worth to cry for?
Off like 10 pills, now I'm stillborn
Gotta stay pure just to make sure
Gotta watch out who you fall for
Smelling like an orchid, I got sources, it's imported
It's another morning, there's no ending to my story
Got the blood veil, I just almost met the reaper
In the shadows and I breathe them
In the ghost house with my people, it's the Shield Gang
I got all these shields and you can't breach them
On a plane, I'm switching seasons
Wait for God to give a reason to me
Daytime creeping, I can't fuck with human beings
I'm not sure what to believe in, I catch commas, not no feelings
You know Drain Gang, I got vampires in my city
Hit the party, take 'em with me, hit me up when I'm not busy
Feel like Casper, feel like you can't see me when I'm friendly
You can see me wearing Fendi as soon as I made my entry
The first born got his world torn
I came out of the ice storm
This blood sword is my light source
At the white shores when the night falls
Was my life form worth to cry for?
Off like 10 pills, now I'm stillborn
Gotta stay pure just to make sure
Gotta watch out who you fall for
Off some pink flats, trying to get my feelings back
Breathing in the ash, X should mark the hidden past
A thousand bits of glass on me, I got glitter hands
Turning into sand, vacuum seal like plastic bags
Sleeping with a chain on me, feel like 50 Shades
Issey Miyake, CDG my aftershave
It feels like acid rain, every day I feel the same
Maybe in a way I will never feel again
I gotta disconnect when they get too intimate
Black Afghan, breaking open cigarettes
I'm so innocent, but I got some evil friends
I just wanna spend, never fall in love againTouch, unite
Out of this world
Everlasting
Flowers bloom
Never-ending
Story of my life
Ballad for the sins
Someone like me
Someone like—
Someone like me
Love me, touch me

High like Fuji, I wonder if you're lonely
I wish you would touch me, touching on my touchscreen
Carbonate my water, put it in the engine
You go to sleep now, time to make my tea now
Bladee, I'm a sword, but my axe is with me now
An elixir, looks like a lighter
Five thousand points, do I look like a liar?
Energy field
Blue steel
I'm unreal, I'm unreal
I'm unreal

Blue steel
I'm unreal, I'm unreal
Got some Red Monkeys to go with my BAPEs
My eyes heavy, I'm smoking grapes
Swag overload, Bladee came up
What I'm smoking on, fuck your brain up
I'm on killer mode, you are hopeless
Float on top of life like a lotus
My gear glowing, I think she notice
No heart, no soul, and I don't got no focus
I'm unreal, I'm unreal
I'm unreal
I'm unreal, I'm unreal

Walk like you, talk like you
In your skin, me and you
When I blow out the candles, the room turns black
When I look in the mirror, my face don't match
When I think 'bout you, baby, my eyes turn black
And I still think about you, I can't go back
Six bags amnesia, to forget my past
Still trapped, nobody under my black mask
Skull cracked, no touching, I got glitter hands
Make a blood pact, me and you, forever lasting
Make a wish for you, baby, the wish turns blue
K-9 in the airport, I look for you
When I look in the mirror, the light turns green
'Cause you don't feel like me
Check my blood-work, how much is my blood worth?
We sending controlled substances through customs
I'm not a crusher, I deserve to suffer
I know that love hurts but sometimes I wonder
Three sixes, two thirds
Thirty percent dirt
Sleeping under Earth
Wake up, end the world
Who'll still my hunger?
Who'll quench my thirst?
First crush, you got burned
I'm ten percent sugar
Give a fuck about the fame, make me stressed out
I be with the same, make you stretched out
Baby got my back, like a rest now
Ain't got no confidence, but I'm blessed now
I don't walk like you shawty, flexed out
You know it's still SBE and Drain Gang
Walk up in the club, they make it rain xans
Everybody talking, I'm the same man
Three sixes, two thirds
Thirty percent dirt
Sleeping under Earth
Wake up, end the world
Who'll still my hunger?
Who'll quench my thirst?
First crush, you got burned
I'm ten percent sugarI don't want to go back to that place again
Nothing will ever be the same again
Never even cared if it's fake, pretend
Maybe you can show me what it takes to end forever
Emptiness, it came again
When it's from inside you know you can't defend against it
Writing, but I can't press send
Kisses from the raindrops tell me "Wait again, one last time"

Use a pocket, fuck a wallet
Pocket watching, pic, I crop it
In Orlando, top, I drop it
Drop, I cop it, I should stop it
I won't make it, might Steve Jobs it
In the mall, tags popping
Blood is dripping on me, falling
Song recall it, now it's never dropping
Treat you like my brother, or my cousin, but you're undercover
Treat it like it's nothing, 'cause it wasn't, and it really wasn't
Might sleep in a coffin, but I wake up, might be drinking coffee
Get these people off me, get you off me, leave it like a crime scene
You might find a copy, but there's no one that can do it like me
Do it like me, do it like me
Misery loves company, so you should come hang with me
So come and hang with me, you should come hang with me
Soon I'll be like you, you see, I take the form I need
Trash on me, cost ten at least, don't speak, I sip my tea
Suddenly it came to me, came to me in a dream
You can't do it like me, do it like me
Can't do it like me, do it like me
Can't do it like me
Can't do it like me, do it like me
Misery loves company, so come and hang with meStop signs and red lights

Flash from a clear sky, let the fear fly
House party nearby, I'm bringing weird guys
I need some wet wipes and some Clear eyes
Stop signs and red lights outside Best Buy
Hit with the Maglite in my head twice
Hit the plug for the drugs, ain't tryna live a long life
I was born with the bad luck, I don't ask why
You don't want to see me out, that's a bad sign
I'm in London, I pass by on the Gray Line
In the cut, going snowblind under red skies
Give a fuck 'bout the next guy, might as well die
I won't fuck with you girl, bye, you're not my type
See my bros get a hundred thousand, I might cry
Might pull up in a Lexus but I can't drive
They say I won't make it but I might try
Need a glove on my hand if we gonna do a high-five
Glove on my hand if we gonna do a high-five
That's a goodnight

If they love me I might hurt them
So I stay behind the curtains
Missing person, I'm a missing person
I'm gone, that's for certain
You won't find me, so stop searching
I stay low-key when I'm lurking
I quit, life wasn't working
The whole world full of serpents
If you cross me then you're cursed, man
Cut your face off like a surgeon
Off the grid, gone off detergents
I can't be seen, it's disturbing
I don't go out 'cause I'm nervous
I won't come back to this world, man
I wanna know what love is
You wanna know what it feels like
Wanted to see you in that light
Now I'm too deep in the night
I'm just ash now, I been burning
When it's rain out, then I'm surfing
Know it's late now, but I'm learning
Everything calm on the surface
Missing person, I'm a missing person
I'm gone, that's for certain
If they love me, I might hurt them
So I stay behind the curtain
Missing person, I'm a missing person
I'm gone, that's for certain

Big bottle of dirty water
Onto the street, walk around dirty Pradas, I feel like F1LTHY
Gotta win something, just let me have it
Just let me hold something, I'm not an expert
If you stand for nothing, what would you fall for?
Fell through a trap door, turned to an actor
Just let me try one time, that's all I ask for
That's all I ask for, nothing too special
If we could merge to one, then we could build something
To recreate myself, I have to kill something
If you would want me dead, I would be into it
I just want your attention
Be my star, three wishes
One that is you
I'm almost gone, grey city
Darkness falls again, one last time
Step on spiders in my Prada loafers
Got them in Austria
Windows open because I got claustrophobia
Paranoid but I feel sober
DG9 CEO striker, bloody Nikes
Living dirty forever, trying to die nicer
Dio, freeze you, I'm a icer
Dirty weed, it smell like rubber
I've been workin' undercover
I can't go out like a sucker
Bloodless I don't wanna go there
Run the city like it's Gotham
Link ten bags, I had to lock 'em
Virgin blood, I like it fresh man
See three stars, I must collect them
Evil calling, I neglect it
Ecco2K, we talkin' to dolphins
I won't talk to no imposter
Quit this shit, I pulled the Joker
Sit down with me, start it over
Hot or cold, I'm coming closer
I can't go out like a loser, I can't go out when it's sunny
Big bottle of dirty water
I do the street, walk around with dirty Pradas, I feel like F1LTHY
Gotta win something, just let me have it
Just let me hold something, I'm not an expert

Come in with the Garbage Pail Kids, we some tyrants
Leave that shit to me, I take 'em out I got a license
Drenched in snow look like blow, blow, blow
Puerto Rican gold just for my nose, nose, nose
Never ending story on the road, road, road
Me and Bladee gon' pop 'em like some toast, toast, toast
It's a movie man, HD, I make it three-peat
Bleed on me like Fiji; I'm trapped in 3D
It's me and Leany, gone, I feel like E.T
Easy, for you it was hard, for me it's easy
I make you see me, 3M, bitch, she geeky
Prada, no CC, old dog, you can't teach me
Pressure on me, G, play you like a CD
I'm up at 8:30 chasing the feeling
Mouth filled with blood, now I got blood on my rug
Ten X pills, ten bitches in the tub
Meals with my team and you crawling for the crumbs
I was born in the cave, baptized in the mud
Me and the gang in an Uber creepin' up
Two blunts up and two cups stuffed
I'm done with this city, y'all some rats and some bums
Checks on checks, paper planes, tear it up
Fuck it, I make a movie with you, cut it
Sacrifice myself for you, now I'm bloody
I'm not a lover, man, switch that to the other
I'm with Yung Lean, man, that's my fucking brother
Fuck it, BladeeCity, that's my brother
World War IV, got the twin towers bussin'
Fuck it, mixin' bleach with my cousin
With the family, we stay loyal like the Russians
I'm crushing dirty pills up, I need a couple
Harry and Meghan, man, show you how much I love it
I want the trouble, straight pain, don't need a stunt double
Comfortable, middle of the winter it feel like summer
Hop out, rockin' D&G, haha, we the new KGB
Don't know what you see in me; my wrist laser, no A&P
Hop out rockin' APC, restin' under my cherry tree
My soulmate buy the Burberry, but I be sippin' Hennessy
Red velvet
I'm selfish
10 bands just to go and eat some shellfish
I felt it, I felt it
We can't go on like Elvis
Fuck it, I make a movie with you, cut it
Sacrifice myself for you, now I'm bloody
Fuck it, I make a movie with you, cut it
Sacrifice myself for you and now I'm bloody

Plastic face, tragic on the way
Only way I make it through the day is, I can't say
I can't say, sorry, I can't say
Sorry, mom, I know you hate to see me this way
Fall in love and jump
Are you drunk? I was actin' dumb
Pills under my tongue, I feel numb
Don't like anyone
Empty, fill my cup
I fucked up, cut me up my cut
Catch you out, you're slumped, he's a bum
Drain Gang, yeah, we on
I'm the chosen one, fuck you thought?
Get back what I love
I make the call, are you slow?
Reap the risk I sow
FuckSmoking drain

When she saw me come down, I made her fall in love
Might catch a sundown, 925 my arm
Neck and I'm washed out, I need a bar of soap
I'm still on lockdown when I am all alone
I-I-I'm still combining when I'm on my own
Two and the white line, calling me like a phone
Dress up for you, yeah I feel like a college boy
Fiends in the black light, street lights carry on
I'm in dark both night and day, I want to but I can't stay
Don't know why, so I can't say
Going missing, MIA
You're my drug, I'm DEA
Just for you, I catch a case
Just for you, I cut my face
I keep going in a maze
How they change, I pump the brakes
Cut the lames, won't say a name
Pull up late, I know they hate
Pull my jewelry out the lake
You're a snake, I take your place
Gotta eat, I take your plate
I can't wait, I take it straight
I'ma take it to the face
Smoking drain
I'ma take it to the face
I'ma take it to the face
Smoking drain
I'ma take it to the face
Toxic waste, I need an eighth
I'ma take it to the face
Lead the way, can't leave no trace
Change my shape like it's some clay
Cut the brakes and let it shake
Cross the king and get away
I see grey like Fifty Shades
She want Bladee, I run away
She wanna meet me at my place
Duct tape on my license plate
Stay away, I switch my state
Silver trees look like a brace
Yeah, I wait for your embrace
Pledge allegiance to the rain
Yeah, it's Bladee, I'm just a stain
Fuck the fame, don't say my name
Yeah, you fake, and it's a shame
See you fail, can't look away
I'ma take it to the face
I'ma take it to the face
When she saw me come down, I made her fall in love

Black lake, blue pond, I hear the sirens call
I'm in my special place
No end, just grey, I let it go for days
I'm taking off my face
No start, just grey, I'm in my special place
I'm in my special place
Public display me, shame me, baby
I do it all for you, rate me
Lie and betray me, hate me, you play me
I'll be whatever you make me
Always crying 'bout yourself, make me wet
I can be your pet, play dead
Can step on my neck, walk over my head
My eyes are red, Drain Gang, we triple threat
I stay in the night, I should go to bed
I'm playing with the meds, it's going to my head
Playing with the meds, it's going to my head

Rob him for his Roshes, can I buy emotion?
Pull up in a Lotus, sitting next to Joseph
It's so hard to focus when everything is broken
I know that it's over, but I'm trying to hold on
You know that my soul's gone, but let me put this gold on
Gold on my girl in the dream world
Rainworld of angels, shadow reaper
Shadowface, make my city break, everything is fake
Bitter pain, make it go away, shadows on my face
Shadowface, make my city break, everything is fake
Bitter pain, make it go away, shadows on my face

You know me, I don't know you
You want me, I don't want you
Drugs in my veins and I feel like I'ma die soon
Heart beating fast, wind blowing like a typhoon
Blood on my shoes, thinking about you
Looking in the mirror and I don't see you

Nobody understand, they can't fuck with that
Shield Gang, you can fuck with that
Had a heart attack but I came back
She can't do me like that while I'm smoking on this pack
Woke up in the bank and I'm higher than my rank
Flexin' like a tank
GTB, Shield GangBad adrenaline, oh, they just say anything
Just know they'd do anything to be in the spot you're in
Back to bed again, skin on me, I shed again
Bein' in the head I'm in, I would need a better friend
Tell me everything, I been through it, veteran
Bring it up to me again just so I can feel again
Nothin' better than when there's nothing happening
DG, it's a family thing, don't be an embarrassment

If I don't know you, you get Xd out
I've just been planning how to get out
I'm letting go, you're being let down
I'm in the darkness with a rag on
I'm looking for you for the last time
If you're not bleeding, you're not drained out
If you're not bleeding, you're not drained out
Don't lose your face hanging with some lames
I lost my brain smoking toxic waste
The water sprayed with MDMA
I'm with the drain, they won't go away
Don't lose your ways, you can get betrayed
I'm in the shade, but I'm making plays
I'm out, it's late, but I'm on my way
Go to the club, gonna celebrate
If you're not bleeding, you're not drained out
If I don't know you, you get Xd out
I've just been planning how to get out
I'm letting go, you're being let down
Your friends talk behind your back
Told me they don't fuck with you, I didn't even ask
They wanna be Drain Gang but they can't
How am I gon' trust you when you switch up on your man?
Catching all these feelings, catch my hands
I don't catch emotions, I'ma cash out in the bank
Chilling at the roof, you look like ants
You don't know what I've been through, you'll never understand
My heart, where did it go?
My heart, where did it go?
Nobody knows
If you're not bleeding, you're not drained out
If I don't know you, you get Xd out
I've just been planning how to get out
I'm letting go, you're being let downI wanted to be real, wanted to be real
I'm the winner but I feel like a victim
Graduated from the situation, found a solution
Smoking on the pollution, all black suit
Black gloves on, just like a hitman
Trash Star Boys and we sleep in a coffin
Wake up, drinking coffee
I get to it often, might get to it this morning
Prada boots on, look like some Jordans
I'm playing, I'm scoring
DG, Nike, they supporting
Just do it, blade on me, I'm swording
I'm veiled when I'm wielding
Knife in my heart but man fuck how I'm feeling
Can't look at me, you're dreaming
Can't even see me when you are sleeping
Black Volvo, we're creeping
I had ups and downs but it's falling into place
Like the love from God when you look me in my face
I had dreams of life that were lost in empty space
I had almost drowned if I didn't fuck with that drain
I had four, five strikes, at the sixth I lost my wings
I'm the puppeteer, put my puppets into play
Wanted to be real, wanted to be real
Wanted to be realI put a hex on your mind, you put a bless on my line
I put a hex on your mind, you put a bless on my line
You're my river, liquid and silver
I put a check on your name, take more than half of your pay
One second of your time for all of mine
Feelings again, blue night dreaming again
Watching me, tryna copy me and my fam
Fuck with SG and the gang, Louis V locks in my chain
I'ma reach down in the lake, foreign money coming in
I don't trust you or your friend, I don't wanna go back again
Money's frozen in my hand, it's frozen
You don't tell me everything, just tell me anything
Broken glass in my hands, you sell me anything
I walk a mile for your smile, it's embarrassing
I put bleach in my drink, acid in my eyes and shit
I'm feeling paranoid, like the walls is closing in
Feel like I'm made of tin, lost my heart, it went missing
Feel like I'm made of tin, lost my heart, I went missing
Feels like I'm made of tin, lost my heart, it went missing
Drain Gang, it's a gathering
Dripping off my wedding ring, better than I've ever been
Better than I ever been
Lock eyes with a beautiful girl and she's not scared of him
I can be your skeleton, you can be my vitamin
Blade slip out my hand and I bleed out
Thaiboy in New York, bring the weed out
Trashstar at the top in the hideout
Drain Gang got the knife like a boy scout
I put a hex on your mind, you put a bless on my line
You're my river, liquid and silver
I put a check on your name, take more than half of your pay
One second of your time for all of mineHey, man, it's your boy Thaiboy, man

Break me like a icepick , I think I like it
Nightmare in Knightsbridge , I like to buy shit
You think you know me, are you a psychic?
I'm a psycho but I know how to hide it
Get through the crisis, you hate me 'cause my life lit
Don't want your friendship, turn it off like a lightswitch
Prada look like Nikes, open your iris
Ghost ride the whip, I can't even drive it
Take the good things with the rat poison
I fake the whole thing to get in, I'm a trojan
I can't eat, I feel sick, I need soylent
Why me every time? I must be chosen
Wake up, mouth dry, eyes swollen
Life's slow, put the drama in the motion
Think I was your friend, no, I was just trolling
On the endless street, forever roaming
I'm drowning, moment of silence
No fighting, no, I'm not violent
Working on, on dying
I'm wilding, you should stop trying
Stop smiling, you could bring tridents
My boys on, I think you'll like them
Three strikes I'm, I'm striking
I out him, fly by them
Break me like a icepick , I think I like it
Nightmare in Knightsbridge , I like to buy shit
You think you know me, are you a psychic?
I'm a psycho but I know how to hide it
Get through the crisis, you hate me 'cause my life lit
Don't want your friendship, turn it off like a lightswitch
Prada look like Nikes, open your iris
Ghost ride the whip, I can't even drive it
Legendary member, man, Drain Gang, manAll or nothing
One touch will affect you
Insect Crew, venom, I infect you
Thaiboy Goon is who I'm next to
You thought you was with the crew, we finessed you
I'm at Central, meet me by the restroom
Hit my plug for the drugs, I hope he comes soon
Ice cream, boy, we melt you
I was in the spider web but I fell through
Had a dream that I wasn't gonna make it
Maybe we can forget it when I'm faded
I'm in the streets, I'm just waiting for a payment
What you want from me? She want me but I can't save her
We're off pills and weed
You don't wanna try me tonight
I got the knife on me now
You don't wanna die tonight

You don't wanna try me tonight
I got the knife on me now
You don't wanna die tonight
Butterflies on me tonight
It makes you fly to the sky

I just lost a flame
I smoke on Darth Vader
Take you off the radar
Thaiboy, that's my name
I get my foreign from the bay
Me and my homies on the way
We do this everyday
SG, that's my way
Shouts out to all my mistakes
Never seen these Apes
Now I'm feeling well, I'm 'bout to flex the whole day
Flex it, made it made, flex it, made a million
When I'm running 'round in the Stockholm with the drain
People trying to say
They don't know what's up, try and take you far away, away
I could have graduated from Yale
But young Thaiboy chose the fame, fame
Ayeeeeeeeee
You don't wanna try me tonight
I got the knife on me now
You don't wanna die tonight
Butterflies on me tonight
It makes you fly to the sky

Whatever you want, it's easy
Who wanna link up with DG?
Double F, don't need no GG
Night vision, you can't even see
Night vision, you can't even reach me

Mark the tracks when I go, remember me when I go
What's the facts when you talk, and you don’t know?
Make it red in the snow, in the trees like a crow
With my brats buying clothes, we gross
Black bag with the trash pack, weighin' like a stone
I tell Thaiboy send the cash to me through the post
I tell Nino send the stack to me through the post
I've been staying in my head trippin’, nobody knows
I've been moving ten feet back when you're coming close
I've been staying in the Red Light, red like a rose
All this time I got your hopes up, you've been talkin' to a ghost
Forever is a long time, I wasn't even close
Hide my wounds like I'm a pro, now it won’t even show
You’ve been saving up for months, I'ma blow it on clothes
Keep guessing about my next move, you’re not even close
I wasn't even close
I don't wanna get in your way, but you get in my way
'Cause you’re everything when I see you
I don't wanna ruin your day, I just want it to be okay
Guess I'm more than okay when I be with you
I don't wanna tell me your name 'cause it fucks with my brain
Even when I sleep, dreams, I be seein' you
I don't wanna tell you nothing 'cause you know everything
And you see everything when it's me and you
Send German Shepherds after you
Burning sage like a ritual
It's dark, I lost my visual
Double cross, fuck your schedule
Eat the night like a edible
Twenty years, I'm ahead of you
Go to sleep boy, I'm bedding you
Cut you off, I'm beheading you
You're dead, man, so I'm deading you
You're just here 'cause I'm letting you
Drain Boys, VIP, let 'em through
Coming back like a carousel
Drain Gang, it's bad, it's terrible
I'm breathing in the aerosol
Power up like I'm Dragon Ball
I'm still here, it's a miracle
I don't wanna get in your way, but you get in my way
'Cause you're everything when I see you
I don't wanna ruin your day, I just wanna know you're okay
Guess I'm more than okay when I be with you
I don't wanna tell me your name 'cause it fucks with my brain
Even when I sleep, dreams, I'll be seein' you
I don't wanna tell you nothing 'cause you know everything
And you see everything when it's me and you
Dreams, I'll be seeing you
Dreams, I'll be seeing you
Dreams, I'll be seeing you

I wanna get up but I'm coming down soon
Put me on my back, bring me down like a flu
I'm walking until my heels bleed, tryna find you
They tell me I shouldn't worry but it's fake news
You're acting so cold to me but it burns too

I'm talking to myself, it's enough to hate you
I wanna get up but I'm coming down soon
Put me on my back, bring me down like a fluCome to me inside out, from the inside
I get a call for you after midnight
I do a street fight, I get my three strikes
Lie down and bleed out just to see you smile
Come with no makeup on with your hair up
Come to the backstage, I'm in the Red Light
I lay awake late nights past my bedtime
For some of your time, just to see you smile
Lean geeked up for real, how 'bout you?
Yeah we geeked up for real, staying true
Yeah we geeked up for real, staying true
Yeah we geeked up for real, shawty, how 'bout you?
Sunsets, set me free, new light, make me me
How I really understand why it all happened so fast
Peace from the dark soul
It make me smile, yeah, that make me smile
Pray to the wind
I been gone for some time,  gone for some time, Lean
Come to me inside out, from the inside
I get a car for you after midnight
I do a street fight, I get my three strikes
Lie down and bleed out just to see you smile
Come with no makeup on with your hair up
Come to the backstage, I'm in the Red Light
I lay awake late nights past my bedtime
For some of your time, just to see you smile
Come to me inside out from the inside
I get a call for you after midnightNo life left, eat the night, no stars out
I've been thinking 'bout it
Bro came out with the knife, black sky cries
Bleeding rain down on me
Fifty sack in my Nikes, that's for one night
Spent my last cash on it
I'm no longer alive, play with my life
I am getting off it
I don't wanna look bad, get the fuck back
You look like my children, look like Rugrats
I just dropped some new shit, you should cop that
Rolling off some poison, now my eyes black
This not even out yet, fuck an outlet
I know where the snakes at, set the mouse trap
Blowin' on the loud pack by the trash bags
Everyday I wake up, different houses
You look kinda suspect, I don't like that
Twenty on my left wrist, 'cause I swipe that
She know me from IG, I don't like back
I just need a nightcap and a white mask
First I get your face scanned in my webcam
I just need a rope man and a hangman
Thaiboy pulled out  10 bands, call the dopeman
Hundred on the smoke man, we the smoke gang
No life left, eat the night, no stars out
I've been thinking 'bout it
Bro came out with the knife, black sky cries
Bleeding rain down on me
Fifty sack in my Nikes, that's for one night
Spent my last cash on it
I'm no longer alive, play with my life
I am getting off it
No life left, eat the night, no stars out
I've been thinking 'bout it
Bro came out with the knife, black sky cries
Bleeding rain down on me
Fifty sack in my Nikes, that's for one night
Spent my last cash on it
I'm no longer alive, play with my life
I am getting off itFirst time, first time like a virgin
I'm a fiend for the drugs, who is serving?
They want to be me like they're Kirby
But I'm too advanced, it's not working
I come from the rain, are you thirsty?
I'm in love with pain, someone cursed me
Take a chance with me, is it worth it?
I'm gonna stay up 'til it's not even that early
Every time I get a chance, it gets out of hand
Burning through the grams to the point where it gets sad
I'm still in the land where nobody understand
But I'm with the gang, and they know that it gets bad
Fucked it up again when I'm fucked up off a Xan
What the fuck is happening tonight, what's the plan?
They don't wanna see me make it to the top
But I'm feeling like I'm being watched
Everywhere I go, I'm seeing locks
But I got the key on me, it's hot
I don't wanna go out 'til it's dark
I've been goin', goin' to the stars
They don't wanna see me getting guap
But I'm getting money, I can't stop
First time, first time like a virgin
I'm the Drain Gang Rainman, what you saying?
Ralph Lauren what I'm draped in
Off a pill in a daydream
When they see the shine, then they changing
And I lost my mind, now I'm fading
When I go to sleep, I am praying
Hundred million cash for the Rain King
I fell in love with drugs, now we're datingYeah, I'm wicked, that's my only weakness
You gon' leave me speechless, I can't beat this fever
Yeah, I'm speeding, I am off to meet her
I am not a dreamer, I could be your teacher
Nice to meet you, wouldn't wanna be you
For you I am see through
Can't you see I need you?
I can treat you good if I can reach you
In the night I beep you, like I'm R2-D2
20 stacks, I spent that on trees
And you can't smoke that with me
You can't even talk to me, my agency need a fee
Got the gift, God gave it to me
They wanna take it from me
What do you want me to be?
Make a wish and turn into me
Botox lips, goodnight kiss
Blood and spit, I wait for it
Are you up? Try this, gloves don't fit
Hands don't grip, six dices
Botox lips, goodnight kiss
Blood and spit, I wait for it

Yeah, Thaiboy, yeah

La-la-la-la-la, I pour, I pour, I pour
I pour, pour up, pour up
I tell Ecco, need some GT-R, we had to get it right
Hit the jungle on this scooter, burning my night
Even though I'm off the shit, I have to make it right
It's kinda nice, one million every time I roll a dice
It's kinda nice
Thaiboy Goon, yeah, doing what I like
Overpriced, yeah, that's my favourite price
I like to get it, on this planet, I'm feeling nice, Thaiboy
Far, far, far, far, far
La-la-la-la-la, I pour up, pour up, pour up
I pour, pour up, pour up
La-la-la-la-la, I pour up, pour up, pour up
I pour, pour up, pour up
If it's too slow, me and Thaiboy gotta go
How did you know? Drain, I could have been a pro
I'm on that shit and I never could say no
I have to live if tomorrow never show
Do a show, making money off the trolls
Sun is gold and I'm liking what it showed
You never been around celebrities, it shows
I go, I go, I go, watch this shit unfold
Butterflies, pins and needles
I wash my eyes and mouth with soap
Don't wanna stop this feeling
But I knew I had to let it go
Just kill it, I want to lose this evil
Innocence, I want it
Go against my wishes
Like really
I wonder to myself, I really want to know
What is it?
I'm feeling something eating at my soul
As long as you lose, that's all on you
I gotta tell the truth, I break the rules
Do what I gotta do, I had to, ha

Gotta do it
Beauty's thin when you're in
When you walk through the ring
Had to sin just to win
Had to fly with the wings
Plead the guilt for the kill
For a touch of the skin
Feels so close, like an inch
Feels like needles and pins
If you lose, that's all on you, ha, ha, ha
Break the rules, I gotta tell the truth, ha, ha, ha
If you lose, that's all on you, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Gotta do it, ha

Been getting money? I want you to show it
I got the key to the city
Twitter at me, it's @Bladeecity
It is me, just admit it
One hundred fifty just to kick it
We got to keep the party going
2019 it's how i'm coming
Caught up, caught up in a bad moment, take it as a omen
Put a mask on my face, now I look like an emoji
Sign on the door, it says "Drain members only"
How could I be so greedy?
I put myself first when you needed me the most
You can fool me so easy, put myself down when you needed me so low
Was it all for no reason?
I think about you, I think about us sometimes
Clean the street with the bleach, and
Take my shoes off, walk with you somehow
Ecco, he keeps the party on him, rolling I'm rollin', rollin', rollin'

The source of the drain, man
The one and onlyStill sick, still sick, still sick
Still sick, still sick
Still sick, still sick
Still sick, still sick
Still sick, twelve grams in a zip
Us, we don't mix
Triple six for my wrist
Blood on my lips
I can't stand, I'ma sit
I was broke, now I'm fixed
Black skies ever since
I hope I won't be missed
From the rain to the snow, going in
I am sick, I'm not sane
I don't know what I think
I can't see anything
Call my friends, give me wings

Don't get lost in this shit

Turn the maze into a place where you're safe
Right now stepping on the graves even
Everything will wither and decay
But the energy will stay
Everyday, early, late , every second even
Turn away for nothing just in case
A sensation but it's strange
In a way everything is a secret even-
Call myself a vessel, not a name
Call a taxi in the rain
Take a plane out of space to confess, I need it
Endlessly reflecting in your gaze
Drop the mirror and it breaks
Seven years, seven tears, seven different heavens
Blue and black I chase another shade
And I'm transcending the grey
To the rainbow in my brain, this array of colour
Endlessly go over my mistakes
Just to find out what it takes
To be great, separate, differentiating
You hold on to me, the part that stays
Makes me grounded in a way, fly away
But today I'll go up, I know it
I throw all my sympathies away
Pray my card will be a ace
Put my palm over my face
I can't stand to watch it
Everything is perfect in the void
I don't want it to be spoiled
I avoid it for so long, but I can't forever
Endlessly reflecting in your gaze
Drop the mirror and it breaks
Seven years, seven tears, seven different heavens
Blue and black I change another shade
And I'm transcending the grey
To the rainbow in my brain, this  array of colour
Endlessly go over my mistakes
Just to find out what it takes
To be great, separate, differentiating
You hold on to me, the part that stays
Makes me grounded in a way, fly away
But today I'll go up, I know itYeah
Air Force Drain colorway, black and gray
Darkness can't stay away, it's a holiday
What pain do I choose today? I'ma contemplate
Silicone world, it's all fake, let's play a game
In the drain way they all float, except my blood bros
I tote big bags of smoke, can you help me roll back home?
They wanna know me now, that's a no
Be like you, I can't be close 'cause I can't go broke
Dope, I'ma overdose, going comatose
Can't hate on a ghost, in the night I go
Redlight moments, we rolling the potent
Going and going, going, I'm going
4 AM and it's snowing, it's snowing
Chain on me glowing, moon hit the ocean
Walk away from me, babe, in slow motion
Rolling, I'm rolling, feels like I'm choking
Your bracelet's not clean, it made your wrist green
Same people that's hating on me also wanna be me
I can't see you like I'm Stevie
If I can't beat it, let it beat me
If I can't eat the night, I'ma let it eat me
If you can't leave you, gon' lose me
I don't wanna talk about no clothes and no music
Smoking through the pack like it's Marlboros
Before you can get in, scan your face like a barcode
Look at me, I'm gone like it's stealth mode
You can't hit my line no more, I got a new cellphone
I'm playing poker but I got bad luck
The numbers don't add up, the numbers don't add up
I'm playing both sides, yeah, I'm a bastard
I know it don't matter, I want what comes after
Red-Red-Redlight moments, we rolling the potent
Going and going, going, I'm going
4 AM and it's snowing, it's snowing
Chain on me glowing, moon hit the ocean
Walk away from me, babe, in slow motion
Rolling, I'm rolling, feels like I'm choking
Redlight moments, we rolling the potent
Going and going, going, I'm going

Walk away from me, babe, in slow motion
Rolling, I'm rolling, feels like I'm chokingWake up in the morning
Looked at my phone, brushed, it's boring
Dress up just for nothing
Doing what I'm meant to for nothing
Why did you come around me? I wanna know your motive
Why are you getting so T-d if you can't even hold it?
T Star and D&G, I became the owner
Nothing in life is really free, yeah, I had to call it
Don't be projecting on me, do you mind?
I don't wanna be seen, is that a crime?
6 upside down, that's a 9
Dolce & G, on the rise
Backstab 'em down, caught 'em by surprise
Just talked to your friends, they're gonna let it ride
Don't grow around me, pesticide
Had to follow my dreams, the wron-ong way
Let's switch around, see how you like it
I Mitsubishi off, she thought that I would chase it
You look confused as to why you're not gonna make it
Let's play a game of life, my dealer got the 8-bit
It's either me or you, I had to make arrangements
Can't trust in everyone, don't matter if you like it
They talk 'bout everything, I keep my business private
You stain my silk blood, drop your nose, girl, let me wipe it
Wake up in the morning
Looked at my phone, brushed, it's boring
Dress up just for nothing
Doing what I'm meant to for nothing
People will whisper, they'll make their jokes
Let them
They're all so small, I can't even see them
I only see what matters
Bad adrenaline, oh, they just say anything
Just know they'd do anything to be in the spot you're in
Back to bed again, skin on me, I shed again
Being in the head I'm in, I would need a better friendEverything came back to me
Every path leads back to you again
Everything came back to me
Every path leads back to you again
Perfect, you got perfect details
Like my skin, baby, perfect
Perfect details

Hit her with the "you can't come, it's private"
I can’t eat, I had to go on a diet
Can't you tell I keep it on a budget?
Beating myself up, I'm with the violence
In a tunnel, vision, I see no way out
And it's Disney Channel in the playhouse
I'll wake you up at the ending
It's true, you can never be this high
There's no winner or losers in this fight
Everything you think of all time
I don't want your body, touch your mind
They want to know how I am so trendy
33, they say I got too many
Be like me, let me know when you ready
Metal round my wrist, it’s weighing heavy
Wanna be the hero of my story
Baby, if you let me be annoying
Wanna wake up early in the morning
I just never wanted to be boring
Wanna be like me you can’t afford it

Never be like me, to be honest
They like how I’m steppin' with the Prada's

Dead inside, but I still smile
I got nine lives in the X-Files
Dark outside, let the moth fly
Audi pass by, bloody red eyes
Drained the night, blood moon cried twice
Silver shine bright, NoLife Gang rides
Stain the knife, stepped on blind mice
Stepped on white ice, then I changed price
Headless, razor-wire necklace
You look so helpless, let me be your weapon
I got no love, but it's whatever
I don't remember any happy endings
Play dead, I'm escaping
I'm a famous ghost, no location
I told them go talk to my agent
Faded in the suburbs getting braided
Aching, when will I ever be painless?
Medication, memories erasing
Drain Angel stay under surveillance
Still waiting, I've been gone for ages
Went to LA, got a facelift
I just want someone to play with
And lately I've been feeling jaded
Stay away from mirrors 'cause I still don't talk to strangers
Dead inside, but I still smile
I got nine lives in the X-Files
Dark outside, let the moth fly
Audi pass by, bloody red eyes
Drained the night, blood moon cried twice
Silver shine bright, NoLife Gang rides
Stain the knife, stepped on blind mice
Stepped on white ice, then I changed price
Dead inside, but I still smile
I got nine lives in the X-Files
Dark outside, let the moth fly
Audi pass by, bloody red eyes
Drained the night, blood moon cried twice

Stepped on white ice, then I changed priceUpside down world, you and I, girl
I'm a stalker her, she's a dancer
Brand new nightmare, I'ma die there
Darkness holds me, it's my cancer
Brand new backstab, need a catnap
Brand new black mask in my backpack
Drain Gang rain man, I will be back
Just two setbacks from a relapse
How come you always look down every time we come around?
Draining in the haunted house and there is no boys allowed
Drain Gang boys, we creep at night, when the world is upside down
Find out what I think about, bleeding like it's Valentines
I need two new bank accounts and nothing to care about
Find out what I dream about, come out when them fiends are out
2 bros and 3 hang arounds, I don't hang around with clowns
Kill the light and eat the night, now I'm not so dead inside
Upside down world, you and I, girl
I'm a stalker her, she's a dancer
Brand new nightmare, I'ma die there
Darkness holds me, it's my cancer
Brand new backstab, need a catnap
Brand new black mask in my backpack
Drain Gang rain man, I will be back
Just two setbacks from a relapse
Bleeding from my nose, famous ghost, I'm XxPosed
I got smoke, but I got nowhere to go
I don't have a soul, broke my organs and my bones
Hope nobody knows, need a extra sugarcoat
How could I say no to you? How could I ever refuse?
I'm with Bladee and Thaiboy Goon and we smoking NO2
I wish death on all of you, who will make my wish come true?
Need to get my heart removed, crush it up and drink the juice
I want her, she wants to get burned, I want her, she wants to get burned
Cigarette burns on her fingers, my girlfriend was covered in burns
C Klein necktie and a white shirt, I'm a stalker, not a spider
Take my heart out, wait for my turn, break apart, let's see who dies first
Upside down world, you and I, girl
Ooh, oohThat thing you do
That thing you do
Blood drips from my eyes
I don't know where to hide
You lie all the time
They're lies that I can't buy for free
You leave me constantly
When I am most in need
Running, running like a greyhound
If you tell me lay down, you know that I will stay down
RIP my lungs, I'm smoking napalm
RIP my lungs, I'm smoking napalm, tell me who you wait on
RIP to life, I'm gonna stay gone
Can't hang with a peon, things you do to me, making me wrong

Been around, still around the finish line
Background check them 'fore they come around
Drain Gang tree house and you're not allowed
Dead tree branches and they hanging down
I smell the money, gotta hunt it down
Still talking 'bout me, gotta cut it out
They're moving sideways but it's going south
You remind me of someone that I forgot about
It's getting crazy in the haunted house
I might pop out and sleep on the couch
Used to have demons but we're homies now
Used to be on some shit but it's over now
I'm on the phone and it's over out
You've been tryna run into me on my coldest night
I can't go if it's not feeling right
And I'm in the dark tunnel but I see a light
It's a hard day, I might get an upgrade
I get the stop made even when I'm up late
Been a long way, it really came a long way
Might get a heartbreak swimming in the dark lake
They call me Boss BladeeCity where the sword lays
I've seen a late night turn into a morning
I know you hate me but it's not important
I know 'bout death 'cause it's waiting at my doorstep
This is not fake so you can't afford it
I can't have fans 'round 'cause they wanna record me
I'm in your city, that's another story
I fuck my real life up 'cause that shit bore me
I'm in some Air Force, can't do Michael Jordan's
I know you hate me, I'm working when you're snoring
And I've been global so there's nothing foreign
They know my name, I am buddies with the doorman
Been around, still around the finish line
Background check them 'fore they come around
Drain Gang tree house and you're not allowed
Dead tree branches and they hanging down
I smell the money, gotta hunt it down
Still talking 'bout me, gotta cut it out

Bookbag full of white and they all in the supersize
Thaiboy fucking goon, got it all like a superstar
Thirtieth floor in BK, that's a crazy town
Really had it coming, ain't no way around
GTB when they around, time goes super slow
Hundred cities, hundred towns, I'm doing shows
Thirtieth floor, in the thirtieth floor
Thirtieth floor, in the thirtieth floor
Sour cherry
Taste like candy
You as my destiny
They can't stand me
I'm not standing
I keep that energy
Silver camo
Guilt and pleasure
It got the best of me
Kiss the candle
Blow the cover , but do it casually
Bookbag full of white and they all in the supersize
Thaiboy fucking goon, got it all like a superstar
Thirtieth floor in BK, that's a cursed town
Really had it coming, ain't no waiting around
GTB when they around, Thaiboy sip it slow
Hundred cities, hundred towns, I'm doing shows

A dream of life
Thirtieth floor, in the thirtieth floor
Kiss the candle, love the coverWhen I'm coming home, they call me Vännen
Waiting for forever for my weapon
Waiting for my best friend outside 7-Eleven
Sometimes I just wanna go to heaven
When I'm coming home, they call me Vännen
Some people, I wanna just forget them
They wanna get close, I never let them
Running through the money, gotta get them
Gotta get away within a second
Don't talk to me like you're not basic
Know your place bitch, Gucci on my face, bitch
Hundred Ks, six runners, I go racing
Going crazy, pull up in Mercedes
I can't take this, smoking on the daily
Call me maybe, hit me on my FB
I am SG, when you feel press me
Don't address me, please learn how to dress, please
Waiting for forever for my weapon
Waiting for my best friend outside 7-Eleven

Some people, I wanna just forget them

Running through the money, gotta get them
Gotta get away within a secondMix the six, it's all warped
You're so sweet, I need salt
This your job, here's your stage
Speak your truth, it's okay
Eat the night, through the veil
Shield the flame, bless the rave
In this world, watch me age
Be the love, birthday cake
What would it take to make it break?
Whatever that is, I can't save it
Walk away, Holygrace
I like it better when it's naked
What you say?
You're not even drain
I wanna see what you hold sacred
Wipe the smile off of your face
Fuck your birthday cake, happy drain day
Keep it silent in the circle
You're the part of me that is so perfect
Keep it silent in the circle
You're the part of me that is so perfect
Don't try that with me, it isn't worth it
Made the hotel to a place of worship
Make the music when it is submerging
Heavy load, I keep it on me, burden
I don't wanna see, close the curtain
It's not even that early
But the sky's looking purple
What would it take to make it break?
Whatever that is, I can't save it
Walk away, holy grace
I like it better when it's naked
What you say?
You're not even drain
I wanna see what you hold sacred
Wipe the smile off of your face

Prada nightcrawler, I'm your stalker
The lights dancing on my neck look like water
It gets harder, it gets darker
Good pack just came in, it smell like a marker
American Cup sneakers, these ain't no joggers
Think I caught her like a spider
I might keep her for a week then I drop her
Fuck a copper, got it from my doctor
Drain Gang high school, yeah, I'm a scholar
I won't fight you, I can't be bothered
Baby, I can't text you, I'm not a author
The Stars calling for a offer
Big Drain, do or die, I don't want no suicide
Good boy, crucified, I come alive
Big knife on my side, I don't wanna utilize
Big blade, butterfly, open the sky
When the night calling I might fall in
I went all in, I can't come out
My jaw locking, feel them watching
I'm done talking, the dark come out
The Drain pop out like we boy scouts
The Drain pop out like we boy scouts
Your team too weak, you're getting forced out

Take a knife and drain your lifeThat's on my life
That's on my life
If there's love...
If there's love in your heart, I'll find it
Can't see me in the snow, I'm blinded
If you see me on the street, don't mind it
Off the trashpack, that's my diet
Let's go, I'm gone like lightning
Peaceful but my bro real violent
I'm a psycho but I know how to hide it
In the night but I'm not tired
Blood on my shoes but it's not Margiela
Link like I'm Zelda, linked in with extra
Watching my moves, trying to capture my treasure
Weed on the dresser, feel like a jester
Ghost like I'm Casper, we wait for no answers
Life was okay but I need what is after
After you like a tracker, you backstabber
Alice in Wonderland and I walk backwards
Ghost like I'm Casper, we wait for no answers
Life was okay but I need what is after
Weed on the dresser, feel like a jester
Leave on a stretcher, don't need to be special
Thinking about you, it takes me right back
You showed me if I was on the right track
Credit on the card, we gonna swipe that
If they say strike it, we gon' strike that
I'm shining bright, I'm like a strobe
They're watching me like some drones
I cannot lie
Don't call my phone, leave me alone
Rain on my phone
I cannot lie
I dream of life, it might come true, but now it depends on you
I know you know
If there's love in your heart, I'll find it
Can't see me in the snow, I'm blinded
If you see me on the street, don't mind it
Off the trashpack, that's my diet
Let's go, I'm gone like lightning
Peaceful but my bro real violent
I'm a psycho but I know how to hide it
In the night but I'm not tiredEverlasting flame, see me aiming at your face
Hundred meter blade, put him back inside his grave
I was so afraid 'cause I couldn't feel the pain
Standing in the rain, I put silver in my chain
Snow landscapes, I see ice everywhere I go
Standing in the snow, woke up, I was blowing smoke
Holy ghost hundred years ago, when I didn't know
And your hoe wanted to go home, but you didn't know
Finna snow, always been in Rome, I was building storms
Building wars, I was getting calls from beyond the walls
Sacred halls, went inside the mall, gotta spend it all
Always something new, but I knew you were always false
Everlasting flame, see me aiming at your face
Hundred meter blade, put him back inside his grave
I was so afraid 'cause I couldn't feel the pain
Standing in the rain, I put silver in my chain
Snow landscapes, I see ice everywhere I go
Standing in the snow, woke up, I was blowing smoke
Holy ghost, hundred years ago, when I didn't know
And your hoe wanted to go home but you didn't know
Finna snow, always been in Rome, I was building storms
Building wars, I was getting calls from beyond the walls
Sacred halls, went inside the mall, gotta spend it all
Always something new, but I knew you were always false
Everlasting flame, see me aiming at your face
Hundred meter blade, put him back inside his grave
I was so afraid 'cause I couldn't feel the pain
Standing in the rain, I put silver in my chain
Everlasting flame, got me rocking Gucci shades, now
Holy water in my cup, I ain't had enough
Thaiboy Goon pull up at the church, I ain't going home
Dress up all white, and a big Gucci golden watch
They say that, Thaiboy is the guardian in the watchtower
Holy power, keep me glowing when I'm in the dark
Broken heart, 'bout to go to war, leave you with a scar
Lonely in the dark like a falling star
Brushing into fame, everlasting flame
Put you in the grave, we got burning flame
Eaten by the snake, poison in your vein
You could wash away, in the burning flame
Everlasting flame, see me aiming at your face
Hundred meter blade, put him back inside his grave
I was so afraid 'cause I couldn't feel the pain
Standing in the rain, I put silver in my chainYou know

Can't stop, literally, will I ever be?
This is so surreal, oh no
I had to succeed, cus' I felt the need
Or was it the weed? I don't know
Innocent of all things
Innocent of all things
Innocent of all things
Still a second beating of my heart
Cinderella walking
Cinderella walking
In the realm of all things
Stars, do a spin, seraphim
Lonely, Lonely
Sometimes so lonely
You and I, versus times unfolding light
This sparks joy, make me blush
Pigeon blood red, bring me back up
If you count one this'll add up
Can you match us, try to catch up
This sparks joy, make me blush
Pigeon blood red, bring me back up

Chase my dreams, get it by any means
Blood on me, I got blood, I bleed
Drugs come free, that's why I stay drug free
I been eating good, I been bleeding bad
I felt better 'bout myself when I was feeling bad
We go to Hollywood just to get the cash
If I could I'd sell my soul to the fucking bag
And I made your swag, I feel like your dad
I feel like that is what made you mad
I'ma spend it fast, then we get it back
Hundred racks, I pull it out the trash
Velcro straps
DEO, bitch, I'm back
 Black on black
No trash, no man
Catching flights, I'm jet lagged
 Built like glass
 We use a maskRain check, I get the rain check
I don't want your love, it's tainted
I won't make it, I'm just waiting for a payment
Drain Gang CEO, I'm on the low, close to the pavement
At the station, might just go and take it
I get the rain check then I break it
I won't make it, paid six hundred for these Maisons
Feeling like I'm Jason when I'm paper-chasing
Rainworld, this the matrix
In the Audi racing, I can't see you basics
I'm running like it's Asics
Play you like I play chess, do it for the rain check
Ten stacks, gotta waste it
Fendi is my fragrance, that's the situation
Smokehouse dedication
Fuck a conversation, I'm gonna get wasted

Wish you dance doing ballet
I come in, open up and I fall in
It's like silk, in the wind, flowers swaying
In the ring, in perfect union
It's like love, it's just like in a fairytale
Not enough, it's just not true enough
Catch a breath, I can't even breathe, baby
Feels so fresh, just one and only one
Go around, go

Think I fell for someone, oh, what’s going on?
I’m still covered in Dry g'LOSS and I can’t take it off
Oh, and it’s just me and myself, just the two of us
Spend some time alone with you now, you’re my only one
I’ve got a thing for you
A thing for you?
I think of you
Am I going crazy?
A thing for you
A thing for you
A thing-
It’s so hard to hide but so easy to find
And my heart is blind, I star and cross my eyes
Hydrogen peroxide, lime and ice
Silver lights, I let it oxidize
I’ve been rolling oxen bone
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Baby, kiss me through the phone
Ecco2k, I lost all hope
Smoking on dope, I feel so cold
Smoking on dope, I feel so cold
Live on islands made of stone
Rob that nigga for his coat
Twenty-five thousand on Silk Road
Shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, that glow
Obviously silver, not no gold
Tried to keep up and he went broke
Steaming hot, they don’t want no smoke
2g K, went to the hole
And my heart is fine, I star and cross my eyes
Can never let you cross my mind
Oh, I try, it happens all the time
And my heart is blind, I star and cross my eyes
Can never let you cross my mind
Oh, I try, it happens all the time
Oh, I’m unraveling, and I’m panicking
Feel like I’m paper-thin, and now I’m tearing
Help me please, give me calcium, I think I’m fracturing
I need bandaging, don’t take me back again
I feel like Marilyn, but I’m not acting again
This might be the end, I think it might be
I’m seeing evil men, am I imagining them?
I think I might be
I’ve been rolling oxen bone
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Baby, kiss me through the phone

They all stare at me, I don't care at all
Everywhere I go, they look at me wrong
Every day go the same, gotta stay strong
Something feels so wrong
It's the way I look or the way I walk
Why are you scared of me when I'm not so hard?
No peroxide, I stay dark
"Don't go around him, you might get robbed"
Chop off your body parts
Chop his arm off and take his watch
Crush, crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush, crush, crush
At the bus stop, I be crushin' rocks

3 P.M. and I'm thinking I should get some help
Woke up feeling like, feeling like I'm not myself
I hear voices, I hear voices when I'm by myself
No sex with you but I think that you should fuck yourself
Ice cream baby, leave you in the sun and let you melt
Life or death, what is the difference? I guess I can't tell
Go through hell, I'll make a situation for myself
Go to hell, I'll make a situation for myself
Three vacs on the pack, but you still feel the smell
Watch me baby, I come for you, climbing out the well
I was almost at the top but I looked down and fell
Come and shop with me, mom and dad's money
Please stop tagging me, it looks bad on me
Got a band with me, we can have a party
Me and bro look clean, plastic surgery
They wanna be like me, it's emergency
She say I'm crazy and you worry me
Please stop hurting me, I need surgery
Need a Burberry for my lil' fairy
How could I be so naive?
I can't believe I'm catching feelings
Freezin', I can't feel my teeth
Got snowflakes all over my keys
I'm bleedin' from my nose
My heart is beating too fast
Shallow breathing
See you, baby, you need to leave
No seatbelt, duck into a Prius
You're my missing piece, will you keep my secrets?
I was never evil but I'll be a demon for you
Fly Norwegian to Berlin on weekends
Then go back to Sweden
Please don't break my heart
I promise I'll never get attached to people
Six in the morning and I'm thinkin' I should end myself
3 P.M. and I'm thinking I should get some help
Woke up feeling like, feeling like I'm not myself

Need a Burberry for my lil' fairyShe like me but she think that I'm a weirdo
Me and Nino smokin' out the kilo
I'm a fiend, bro, I'm calling for a black crow
I lost my backbone, don't wanna get it back though
A lot of black smoke falling from the Lambo
On the West Coast it's just me and Ecco
You're holding on to a shadow, gotta let go
Headshot me, I'm swallowed by a black hole
Trash star king, smoke and dirty mirrors
Storm's comin', I feel it in my fingers
Puppet king, they dance, Cinderella
Your glass shoe don't fit, we gon' steal 'em
Who comes out at night? It's a riddle
This not a Oxy', it's a Skittle
Drain Gang boys creepin' in the gutter
This not LSD, it's a puzzle
These are not diamonds, frozen water
Hope you hate my shit 'cause you're garbage
I am home alone in my castle
Life was aight, I don't wanna know what's after
Blood on blood
I'll bring your end
Love your love
Blood on blood
I'll bring your end
All I wanna see is ten-eighty Gs
I'm GTB 'til I RIP
I gotta leave for a couple weeks
Day three, losin' beauty sleep
I-I-I will get it for you, whatever you need
Crushing ecstasy in between my teeth
It's not speed, need a set of keys
I am D&G, drinkin' antifreeze
And my feet don't touch the street
It's not that deep, I don't talk to creeps
Feel like sixteen but I'm not that sweet
She had a crush on me, may she rest in peace
I got the leaks
It's not that deep, I don't talk to creeps
Feel like sixteen but I'm not that sweet
She had a crush on me, may she rest in peaceI'm drinking bleach on the beach, make my teeth white
The darkness is too dark, so I need light
All white armor, looks like daylight
Put the blade to your throat if you don't need life
Blue jeans, two stacks, and they're bleached out
In the car, windows down, don't make me reach out
She said never again, but we speak now
Black heart, black soul, but it's bleached now
Bleached denim, bleached hair
GTB, we don't need air
I don't breathe air, we are smoking weed here
The pack smell like bleach, we don't smoke 'em seeds here
No dirt on my feet, there's no streets here
Marble floor in my house, I'm a cleaner
You can't get inside the gate, got a keeper
Bladee is a leader, pour bleach on my sneakers
I can bleach the darkness out your mind
White powder, white pills, leave your body behind
Sub-zero ice camouflage, leave you snow blind
Spending Bitcoins online, power up in no time
We the future of the frozen city, dressed in bright white
Coming for the cold winter, stay for the nightlife
If you don't dress right, you ain't my type
Albino Alligators finna blow up my spot tonight
I feel nothing, lean without the Robitussin
Catch me smoking White Widow, sipping on a White Russian
Keep me bleached out, buzzing, for your own sake
She said bring me home and give it to me 'til my bones breakCrushing rocks with Oyster Card

I can't lose more sleep over you now
Just this last time
Kiss goodbye, I look for a way out
Make a wish on D-9
Pass my time, go slide on the green line
I don’t play, fast forward and rewind
Press pause and I freeze time
I don't want a one last time
I swear to you, I don't mind
I'm, yeah, I swear I'm fine
Vodka Tonic with ice and lime
Ooh, I swear it’s a waste of time
Ever since I came into your life, I've been losing mine
I don't press stop, I don't rewind
Sad Money Mafia and D9
Stockholm on ice, and I see signs
And I got stripes like Adidas
They wanna look like us and be us
Thaiboy Goon, GTB
We settling for the stars only
Stars only
We settling for the stars only
We settling for the stars only

Vodka Tonic with ice and lime
Ooh, I swear it's a waste of time
Ever since I came into your life, I've been losing mine
You remind me of no one, you're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one I want to be like you
Feel like you, real like you
Walk like you, talk like you
In your skin, me and you
I want to be like you
Feel like you, real like you
Walk like you, talk like you
In your skin, me and you
When I blow out the candles, the room turns black
When I look in the mirror, my face don't match
When I think 'bout you, baby, my eyes turn black
And I still think about you, I can't go back
Six bags amnesia, to forget my past
Still trapped, nobody under my black mask
Skull cracked, no touching, I got glitter hands
Make a blood pact, me and you, forever lasting
Make a wish for you, baby, the wish turns blue
K-9 in the airport, I look for you
When I look in the mirror, the light turns green
'Cause you don't feel like me
Check my blood-work, how much is my blood worth?
We sending controlled substances through customs
I'm not a crusher, I deserve to suffer
I know that love hurts but sometimes I wonder
Three sixes, two thirds
Thirty percent dirt
Sleeping under Earth
Wake up, end the world
Who'll still my hunger?
Who'll quench my thirst?
First crush, you got burned
I'm ten percent sugar
Give a fuck about the fame, make me stressed out
I be with the same, make you stretched out
Baby got my back, like a rest now
Ain't got no confidence, but I'm blessed now
I don't walk like you shawty, flexed out
You know it's still SBE and Drain Gang
Walk up in the club, they make it rain xans
Everybody talking, I'm the same man
Three sixes, two thirds
Thirty percent dirt
Sleeping under Earth
Wake up, end the world
Who'll still my hunger?
Who'll quench my thirst?
First crush, you got burned
I'm ten percent sugarIn the street and I'm drifting like a GT-R
I don't speak at all, guess we need to talk
Barb wire and alarms all around the yard
The city's never dark but I'm seeing stars
Walking out the mall, scarlet Louboutins
Handbag Louis Vuitton and it's free of charge
Platinum Visa card, drinking rubicon
Christian Dior charms with some rubies on
They ask me bout my ones and where I got them from
I'm like, "oh my god" I'm gonna lose my calm
Everything you know and love can soon be gone
If I don't get involved, then you can't do me wrong
Bleeding from my palms, dripping down my arms
I didn't mean you harm, I had a change of heart
Thought your life was hard, that was the easy part
If I say I love you, will you play along?
Bleeding from my palms like The Passion
Tracksuit bottoms and they sagging
Drinking crushed ice mixed with vanish
And it made me disappear like magic
In the wonderland, feel like Alice
I'm thinking let's go do some damage
I got plastic bags full of acid
Whatever happens, happens
In the street and I'm drifting like a GT-R
I don't speak at all, guess we need to talk
Barb wire and alarms all around the yard
The city's never dark but I'm seeing stars
Walking out the mall, scarlet Louboutins
Handbag Louis Vuitton and it's free of charge
Platinum Visa card, drinking rubicon
Christian Dior charms with some rubies onI'm in too deep, I know
In too deep, I know
In too deep, I know
I love to play the victim, I love to play the victim
I love to play the victim, I love to pass the blame
I love to play the victim, I love to play the victim
I love to play the victim, I love to pass the blame
I made a promise not to eat forbidden fruits
Some like it sour, I want you to be my grapefruit
Some like it sweet, don't do it, it's not good for you
I really know I shouldn't do it, but I've got to
I've got to stop it, I've got to get a grip
I've got to stop it, I've got to get a grip
I've got to stop it, I've got to get a grip
I've got to stop it, I've got to get a grip
I made a promise to myself
I made a contract with myself
I walk around, leave no footsteps, left, right, left
I ain't really think about it
I don't wanna try to hurt nobody
I don't want to hurt my own soul too
I don't wanna try to hurt nobody
I don't want to hurt my own soul too

Xbox controllers can’t be controlled
Ecco2k1 played them like Pokémon Gold
I don’t want to know the truth, don’t expect it to be told
Rock a North Face jacket to protect me from the cold
In the Johto region, monsoon season
Smokin' on Aloe from the Garden of Eden
Eyes of a demon, life has no reason
Where are the packs of the power-ups when you need them?
All I wanna see is 1080p
But reality keep me on 240

True friend
Wake up, happy, wash my face in acid
I'm glassy, shattered, wrapped in bubble plastic
I'm fragile, wash my hands in gasoline
Matches and kerosene, please handle me carefully
Sparkly, I'm glossed over
Come here, yeah, come over
I can tell that sounds broken
Stop, smell the roses
I see things in stop motion
Skin, bone and sun lotion
Skin tone like Diet Cola
Skin tone like Diet Cola
So cold, vodka soda
I lost control of it
Zip-lock of rat poison
Salt crystals dissolving, cook off the tap water
Lay down at dawn and crawl back up at nightfall
Stop my racing heart
Beat soft, hard
It stops and starts
My racing heart, it stops and starts
Breaks apart and paints the walls
Where did all this pain come from?
Break the laws and sell the cause
Break my chains, I change my locks
I want to talk to the spirit gods
I talk to you through broken jaws
Broke my teeth on something hard
I'm missing something
I'll do it all for nothing

Hey lil' black boy
Hey lil' black boy
Dreads and makeup
Where'd your head go?
Wake yourself up
Brave lil' black kid
Braids and black ones
Wasted, burned out
Chasing the sun
No joke this time, I'm really ghosting
Yeah, he's got Margielas but he's still posing
I woke up sober, now I'm J.K. Rowling
I'll wake up soulless one day, I just know it
I only have one heart and it's still broken
But if I give it to you would you hold it?
And if it went missing then would you notice?
And would you kiss me if I gave you roses?
Why are you afraid? Why are you afraid?
Wake up with no face, who am I today?
Why are you afraid? What are you afraid of?
Look the other way, uh, you're all the same
Don't let it escape
You gotta kill that snake
Feel like RS-68s
Burn out and get wasted
Hey lil' black boy
Dreads and makeup
Where'd your head go?
Wake yourself up
Brave lil' black kid
Braids and black ones
Wasted, burned out

Wasted, burned outHow she got me fallin'
How she got me fallin'
How she got me fallin'
How she got me fallin'
How she got me fallin'
I shouldn't have went all all in
She got me all bawlin'
She got me when I'm ballin'
On my phone, she callin'
On my phone, she callin'
How she got me fallin'
How she got me fallin'
Shawty, she a baddie and her body tastes like candy
Thaiboy's not her daddy but for shawty, I'ma spend it
Shawty, I'ma spend it
If you want one, I'ma give you ten, ten
Thaiboy never mad, I just wanna win
She will never be sad, she is like a shield
She and me, we racing for a mil'
She and me, we pull up for the kill
Shawty is my bae, she keep it real
She driving me so crazy, but it's chill
Just one look, and she know how I feel
That's how I know that she is real
That's how I know that she is real
Make a call to Thaiboy Goon, let's reunite
Drinking Smirnoff Ice, pour pollution in the clean sprite
Nissan GT-R standing at a green light
In the sky, now I'm feeling like a G5
You remind me of someone, it doesn't feel right
Stainless steel knife, show you what it feels like
No sleep, two keys made my nose bleed
Lately I've been feeling ghostly
And I can't believe in anything you've told me
You don't know me, why you tryna hold me
Silver charms around my throat so I'm choking
Blood is on me, hope nobody noticed
How she got me fallin'
I shouldn't have went all all in
She got me all bawlin'
She got me when I'm ballin'
On my phone, she callin'
On my phone, she callin'
How she got me fallin'
How she got me fallin'Who said this was supposed to be easy?
Silence, I hear my heart beating
You make it look so easy
Forbidden fruit, want to reach for it
Squeeze the juice out and bleed it
Break the skin up and peel it
I'm someone else around people
Lick my lips and eat it
We don't mix together, sugar and diesel
More, more, got to have it
No more, I can't handle it
No one gets to heaven
Uh-oh, that's embarrassing
Oops, no, something happened
Someone please call an ambulance
No more, got to have it
No more, I can't handle it
What's this feeling, what do I call it?
I can't stop thinking, I don't talk about it
Sometimes I don't look where I'm walking
God play tricks on me and I fall for it
Guess I'm sorry, it's my fault
I could have stopped whenever I wanted
Take what you want, I don't want this
A part of me became toxic
Got to get a grip, got to stop it
Got to breathe poisonous oxygen
I can't eat, but it's nothing
Can't go to sleep, but it's nothing
Always something, but it's nothing
Out of nowhere into nothing
I can't stop it, it's compulsive
Someone do something
I brought the bag out like it's nothing
Out of nowhere into nothing
Don't tell anyone
Keep my mouth shut or I spill out my guts
Oh, pretty please with sugar on top
I can stop whenever I want
More, more, got to have it
No more, I can't handle it
No one gets to heaven
Uh-oh, that's embarrassing
Oops, no, something happened
Someone please call an ambulance
No more, got to have it
No more, I can't handle it
Can't have it
No more, can't handle it
No, no, can't have it
No more, can't handle it
No, no, can't have it
No more, I can't handle it
I'm not afraid of anythingI'm in my room, talk to the walls
I hear them sing, la-la-la-la
Falling backwards into the dark
I hear the voices talk so loud
Carry me softly, pull me down
I shut my eyes, cover my mouth
Tell me how
Something so beautiful can taste so foul
So foul
Something beautiful can taste so foul
Look around
Something beautiful can seem so
Worthless

How did you get so perfect?
I wish that I was perfect
You make me feel so dirty
You make me feel so naked
Ohh, I know it's worth it
I want to see you waste it
I want to be perfect
You make it look so perfect
Security, perfect
I know I'll never be perfect
One o'clock, 2 AM to 6 in the morning
One o'clock, 2 AM, I don't recognize myself
Now every time I close my eyes I see the corpses
Every time I look in the mirror I see monsters
One o'clock, 2 AM to 6 in the morning
I can’t hear my thoughts over this running water
Every time I look in the mirror I feel nauseous
Every time I look in the mirror I see monsters
What would you ask if you had one wish?
If you could choose only one thing to fix?
If you had the chance, would you change something?
You could lose yourself, would you take that risk?

Hands on your throat , I can't let go
She'll get three coats , she'll get free coke
Headshot, no scope
Go up in smoke
Should I know you? Sorry if I broke you
You look like you've seen a ghost
You look broken and alone
I wish I could make you whole
Hoping I won't make it home
Bring me close or let me go
Can I trust you? I don't know
Happily ever after, I don't know what happened
Battery pack taste like acid
Panic, hanging out with addicts
No cash, pay plastic
Play you like an actress
MasterCard, I drag it
Face mask, candy wrapper
I don't know what happened
Battery pack taste like acid
Vanish, turn it into ashes
On candy paint, faded away
Stay awake for days, forever I wait
I lay awake, gonna stay up late
Still walking on nails, I met you somewhere
I forgot your name, smell like Holygrace
Taste like acid rain, look like toxic waste
I still need to be saved, all my friends are drain
Need to fix my face, all my friends are snakes
Happily ever after, I don't know what happened
Battery pack taste like acid

Battery pack taste like acid
Vanish, turn it into ashesOh, oh, woah
Yeah, Thaiboy, yeah
Thaiboy, Thaiboy
I tell Ecco, need some GT-R, we had to get it right
Hit the jungle on this scooter, burning my night
Even though I'm off the shit, I have to make it right
It's kinda nice, one million every time I roll a dice
It's kinda nice
Thaiboy Goon, yeah, doing what I like
Overpriced, yeah, that's my favourite price
I like to get it, on this planet, I'm feeling nice, Thaiboy
Far, far, far, far, far
If it's too slow, me and Thaiboy gotta go
How did you know? Drain, I could have been a pro
I'm on that shit and I never could say no
I have to live if tomorrow never show
Do a show, making money off the trolls
Sun is gold and I'm liking what it showed
You never been around celebrities, it shows
I go, I go, I go, watch this shit unfold
Butterflies, pins and needles
I wash my eyes and mouth with soap
Don't wanna stop this feeling
But I knew I had to let it go
Just kill it, I want to lose this evil
Innocence, I want it
Go against my wishes
Like really
I wonder to myself, I really want to know
What is it?
I'm feeling something eating at my soul
As long as you lose, that's all on you
I gotta tell the truth, I break the rules
Do what I gotta do, I had to, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha
I'll break the rules, ha, ha, ha, ha

Break the rules, I gotta tell the truth, ha, ha, ha
If you lose, that's all on you, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Gotta do it
Beauty's thin when you're in
When you walk through the ring
Had to sin just to win
Had to fly with the wings
Plead the guilt for the kill
For a touch of the skin
Feels so close, like an inch
Feels like needles and pins
If you lose, that's all on you, ha, ha, ha
Break the rules, I gotta tell the truth, ha, ha, ha
If you lose, that's all on you, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Gotta do it, ha

Ha, ha, ha, ha, haI woke up today wishin' I was someone else
Took my consciousness away to escape myself
In this body now, I'm a prisoner
Mirages in the desert when I'm missing her
Love was a mirage, but it's over now
Two stops into the town on the overground
Gettin' sober now, had a heart attack
I just lost my life, but you brought it back
Random character select, I had no luck
Disconnect the smoke alarm when I show up
Love is a mirage, T-shirt extra large
Two electric cars came out the garage
But it's over now
Love was a mirage, but it's over now
Getting sober now
Love was a mirage, but it's over now
But it's over now, it's over nowThe clock don't stop

Absorbs to the core
I wish I fall, I sink through the floor
Unless I lost, I lose nothing more
The more I want, the more loses all
The will is lost, I will kiss the gods
I kill my gods and play God of War
I talk to walls and walk through their doors
I kiss my forehead and dance on my corpse

Blunt too scary I’m super high
Moon sand in my Lunar Glides
Designer shoes, designer tees, designer drugs in my designer jeans
I see a soul on each dreams, Blu-Ray disc with laserbeams
Don't pass that 'cause I'm super high
High-altitude gas tanks full of O2
Golden hair, silver shampoo
Going platinum blonde, put the night on blue

Futuristic, jetlag
I'm smoking on some jet pack
Thousand dollar setback
I pull up to the club with my name tags
Some Bapestas, some Reeboks
Asics and G-shocks
Won’t sell tree tops
2 weeks in Tokyo
Paris for the weekend
Ziploc full of powerups
Just came through off eBay
Drops of water
Mouth on Sahara
Came through the party
With a piña colada
ECCO2K, play 'em like a Blu-Ray
Power up for the night
Jet packs all day
Wear our Dolce Gabban-
Wear our shirts from Japan
We refuel, test life
In Hussein ChalayanWake up, F1lthy
Dead inside, but I still smile
I got nine lives in the X-Files
Dark outside, let the moth fly
Audi pass by, bloody red eyes
Drained the night, blood moon cried twice
Silver shine bright, NoLife Gang rides
Stain the knife, stepped on blind mice
Stepped on white ice, then I changed price
Headless, razor-wire necklace
You look so helpless, let me be your weapon
I got no love, but it's whatever
I don't remember any happy endings
Play dead, I'm escaping
I'm a famous ghost, no location
I told them go talk to my agent
Faded in the suburbs getting braided
Aching, when will I ever be painless?
Medication, memories erasing
Drain Angel stay under surveillance
Still waiting, I've been gone for ages
Went to LA, got a facelift
I just want someone to play with
And lately I've been feeling jaded
Stay away from mirrors 'cause I still don't talk to strangers
Dead inside, but I still smile
I got nine lives in the X-Files
Dark outside, let the moth fly
Audi pass by, bloody red eyes
Drained the night, blood moon cried twice
Silver shine bright, NoLife Gang rides
Stain the knife, stepped on blind mice
Stepped on white ice, then I changed price
Dead inside, but I still smile
I got nine lives in the X-Files
Dark outside, let the moth fly
Audi pass by, bloody red eyes
Drained the night, blood moon cried twice
Silver shine bright, NoLife Gang rides
Stain the knife, stepped on blind mice
Stepped on white ice, then I changed priceUpside down world, you and I, girl
I'm a stalker her, she's a dancer
Brand new nightmare, I'ma die there
Darkness holds me, it's my cancer
Brand new backstab, need a catnap
Brand new black mask in my backpack
Drain Gang rain man, I will be back
Just two setbacks from a relapse
How come you always look down every time we come around?
Draining in the haunted house and there is no boys allowed
Drain Gang boys, we creep at night, when the world is upside down
Find out what I think about, bleeding like it's Valentines
I need two new bank accounts and nothing to care about
Find out what I dream about, come out when them fiends are out
2 bros and 3 hang arounds, I don't hang around with clowns
Kill the light and eat the night, now I'm not so dead inside
Upside down world, you and I, girl
I'm a stalker her, she's a dancer
Brand new nightmare, I'ma die there
Darkness holds me, it's my cancer
Brand new backstab, need a catnap
Brand new black mask in my backpack
Drain Gang rain man, I will be back
Just two setbacks from a relapse
Bleeding from my nose, famous ghost, I'm XxPosed
I got smoke, but I got nowhere to go
I don't have a soul, broke my organs and my bones
Hope nobody knows, need a extra sugarcoat
How could I say no to you? How could I ever refuse?
I'm with Bladee and Thaiboy Goon and we smoking NO2
I wish death on all of you, who will make my wish come true?
Need to get my heart removed, crush it up and drink the juice
I want her, she wants to get burned, I want her, she wants to get burned
Cigarette burns on her fingers, my girlfriend was covered in burns
C Klein necktie and a white shirt, I'm a stalker, not a spider
Take my heart out, wait for my turn, break apart, let's see who dies first
Upside down world, you and I, girl
Ooh, oohAll my senses are clues
I can change the rules
So let's do it
Okay, let's do it
Okay, let's do it
I can change the rules

Break the chain, I change the lock-piece
Break the chain, I change the not-peace
Break the chain, I change the rule
Break the chain, I change the rule
I can

Okay, let's do it
Droplets meet the surface
Turn to circles
Into circles
Energy is eternal
One with the earth
Universal
Energy is eternal
Break the chain, I change the lock-piece
Break the chain, I change the not-peace
Break the chain, I change the rule
Break the chain, I change the rule
I can
Let's do it
Think I can, let's do it
I'm not afraid of anything
Energy is eternalMix the six, it's all warped
You're so sweet, I need salt
This your job, here's your stage
Speak your truth, it's okay
Eat the night, through the veil
Shield the flame, bless the rave
In this world, watch me age
Be the love, birthday cake
What would it take to make it break?
Whatever that is, I can't save it
Walk away, Holygrace
I like it better when it's naked
What you say?
You're not even drain
I wanna see what you hold sacred
Wipe the smile off of your face
Fuck your birthday cake, happy drain day
Keep it silent in the circle
You're the part of me that is so perfect
Keep it silent in the circle
You're the part of me that is so perfect
Don't try that with me, it isn't worth it
Made the hotel to a place of worship
Make the music when it is submerging
Heavy load, I keep it on me, burden
I don't wanna see, close the curtain
It's not even that early
But the sky's looking purple
What would it take to make it break?
Whatever that is, I can't save it
Walk away, holy grace
I like it better when it's naked
What you say?
You're not even drain
I wanna see what you hold sacred
Wipe the smile off of your face
Fuck your birthday cake, happy Drain day
Keep it silent in the circle
Fuck your birthday cake, happy Drain dayDark alley, black Audi
Algae, sink 'em to the bottom of the black sea
Blackout, backseat of a black taxi
Black jeans from Acne, matched with a black T
Blood on the pavement, shadow assailant
Don't make a sound, take 'em down with my hatred
Bit-money payments, talk to my agent
Prada sport mist, lost myself in the fragrance
I know about the past but I don't know how to act
Once I lost my innocence, I could never get it back
Black light, out at night, Kawasaki mountain bike
Guardian angels watch over me like satellites
Satellites watch over me like guardian angels
Cover my body with designer labels
Air hockey table, flight mode enabled
New response trails, put them over the cablesSkuggorna dansar igen

Someone come break my fall
'Cause I'm fallin' hard
I'll pray to any god
To create someone
It won't last
But I tried so hard
It won't last
Or it won't happen at all
Ask

It stops and starts
It tears apart

But I tried so hard
It won't last
Or it won't happen at all
Ask
Won't you ask?
Ask
Won't you ask?
To hold my heart
To hold my heart
It stops and starts
(Someone free me from my skin
Evaporated, now I'm gone in the wind)
It tears apart
(Something ended but nothing new did begin
I carry weight until my spine's giving in)
And paints the wallsThere's a star, there's a glimmer
There's a star, there's a glimmer
You're a star, there's a glimmer
There's a star, there's a glimmer
There's a star, there's a glimmer
In my arms, I leave my life in yours
I go on to live so many more
There's a light, there's a flicker
There's a star, there's a glimmer
Just a light, just a flicker
There's a light, just a glimmer
There's a light, just a flicker
There's a light, just a glimmer
There's a light, just a flicker
Don't think twice, don't blink, don't close my eyes
Something's waiting on the other side
One last time, I live life after life
Say goodbye, I walk into the light
I feel like I'm flying and sinking at the same time
Like I'm being pulled from below and from above
In every direction, at onceECCO2K

My eyes are clear and I popped a band
Now a Nike girl wanna hold my hand
It's clear eyes in my eyes

I be the man I be ridin' strong
And I be going straight stupid when I hit the bong
I got meadery, meadery
Hit you in the club with Chidori
I be going ham like sashimi
I be going hunnid like a touareg
Posted in the club in the morning
Posted in the club at night
Bitch, I'm ridin' round on my bike
Bitch, I'm ridin' round on my bike
I got clear eyes
Ridin round in Prague
A pleasant surprise when we ridin' round in disguise
I got clear eyes
With the gravity guys
We ridin' round in disguise
We got clear eyes, am I right?I feel like I'm flying and sinking at the same time
Like I'm being pulled from below and from above
In every direction, at onceCyanide, powerslide
I'm on cell towers and powerlines
Battery life, I'm alkaline
I sleep 12 hours in half the time
Breathing polluted air
I hide my face behind plastic hair
Acid raindrops on a pink Moncler
Got a PowerBook G5 full of spyware
Close your blinds and go back to sleep
I don't believe in reality
Close your eyes and come back to me
I'll take his life like an RPG
Reality check, electronic cigarette
Once you taught me how to feel, baby, how could I forget?
When the sun went down, it never came up
If I go to sleep now, I will never wake up
In the skybox, eating ice-pops
I look into the clouds and release the eye drops
If I go to sleep now, I will never wake upIn the gravity, try to grab me
I don't believe in real life, you know everything
2018, are you scared of me?
Try to blame me with the antifreeze
Getting over me, what you want from me?
ECCO2K1 I got agony
Are you scared of me
I got death in me
Mixing alcopops with that antifreeze
Got to get ECCO2K, everywhere I go
ECCO2 play with 2 keys, get a haircut
See me in the club , believe me
Leave me, ECCO2K, you're gonna need me
Aaa, darkness in the citadel
Go on then, run through the system
Dark blue, Don't need no email
Euphoria, always on me
In the gravity, try to grab me
I don't believe in real life, you know everything
2018, are you scared of me?
Try to blame me with the antifreeze
Getting over me, what you want from me?
ECCO2K1 I got agony
Are you scared of me
I got death in me
Mixing alcopops with that antifreezeI'll tell you the truth
Just maybe I wanted to lose
You want this, I wanted it too
Come down to me, I'll walk with you
I wanted to lose, come with me
Well, maybe I wanted to lose
Well, maybe , I'll tell you the truth
Just maybe, I wanted it to come down to me
I walk with you
Think something's wrong with you
You let it talk for you
I want that high fever
I let you walk on me
Baby, you're my beetroot
I just want to squeeze the juice out and drink you
You're my grapefruit
I just want to squeeze the juice out and drink you
Oh no, look what you made me do
You're a grapefruit, some like it sour
I'll tell the truthI'm alright, It's alright
I'm alright, I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm okay
I'm alright, I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm okay
It's alright, I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alrightTurn into a ghost I'm escaping
I told them go talk to my agent
Faded in the suburbs getting braided
Aching when will I ever be painless
Medication, memories erasing
Drain Angel stay under surveillance
Still waiting, I've been gone for ages
Turn into a ghost I'm escaping
I'm a famous ghost, no location
I told them go talk to my agent
Faded in the suburbs getting braided
Aching when will I ever be painless
Medication, memories escaping
Drain Angel stay under surveillance
Still waiting, I've been gone for ages jacket, I'm gone
Help me, I'm gone
Hit me up and I'm gone
Wrap it up and get goin'
I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
 like my gun
Jetlag and I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
Purple drinks and I'm gone
A hundred faces, I'm gone
12 faces, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
Gone, ahhDark alley
Black Audi
Algae
Sink them to the bottom of the black sea
Blackout
Backseat of a black taxi
Black jeans from Acne
Matched with a black T
Blood on the pavement
Shadow assailant
Don't make a sound
Take them down with my hatred
Bit-money payments
Talk to my agent
Prada Sport Mist, lost myself in the fragrance
I know about the past
But I don't know how to act
Once I lost my innocence I could never get it back
Blacklight
Out at night
Kawasaki mountain bike
Guardian angels watch over me like satellites
Satellites watch over me like guardian angels
Cover my body with designer labels
Air hockey table
Flight mode enabled
New response trails put them over the cables

Had you in my arms, take care of my baby
Riding in the exec that's a Mercedes
Something in the air, baby can you taste it?
Early in the morning, it's back to basics
Twenty for a show, know, you gotta pay me
Ecco call me up, we going too crazy
Thaiboy in the cut, how could you not hate me?
I go, go, go too hard, go too far now I can't stop
Ooh, ah, I can't watch, close the gate and change my locks
I made a hole inside of myself, I jumped into it, inward falls
Crawling up the walls, covering my ears like la, la, la
Human shields, bodyguards, watching through the intercom
I can't stop my racing heart, crushing rocks with Visa cards
Feel it in my jaw, got so many thoughts but I can't talk
Drip, drop, on my Macintosh, I can't wipe it off
I-I-I be turning up, how can you not blame me?
Designer drugs, feel like the '80s
I be on a yacht, feel like the navy
Designer drugs, it feel like the '80s
Thaiboy turning up, Thaiboy in the club
I'm mixing up Moncler in my double cup
Smoke in the air, I don't give a fuck
Money in the bank, had to double up
I'm mixing up Moncler, I'm going crazy
It's GTB, chief commander baby
She said she really miss me, if I'm not mistaken
Blue bands, had to go and get it
Jil Sander look like H&M
Football, play it like I'm Harry Kane
Good greens, gone off the Mary Jane
Insect gang, eat everything
Ooh, I became a legendary member
Fendi or the Prada? Can't remember
I'm with Power Rangers, no Avengers
Thaiboy Goon so icy like December
Double crushed ice
Leandoer with the Sprite
Walking on the moon, with Foamposites
Walk up in the club and turn the lights off
Dropping blood in the stiff club
Drug deals in strip clubs
Centerpiece, I bleed bugs
Need rebirth and re-up
Got work, bring the fee up
On top, I don't see nothin'
F is for Fendi, I don't rock no Fila
I can't trust him
He's up to something
He's up to something
I can't trust them
If I don't love them
If I don't love them

Just one look, and she know how I feel
That's how I know that she is real
That's how I know that she is real
Make a call to Thaiboy Goon, let's reunite
Drinking Smirnoff Ice, pour pollution in the clean sprite
Nissan GT-R standing at a green light
In the sky, now I'm feeling like a G5
You remind me of someone, it doesn't feel right
Stainless steel knife, show you what it feels like
No sleep, two keys made my nose bleed
Lately I've been feeling ghostly
And I can't believe in anything you've told me
You don't know me, why you tryna hold me
Silver charms around my throat so I'm choking
Blood is on me, hope nobody noticed
How she got me fallin'
I shouldn't have went all all in
She got me all bawlin'
She got me when I'm ballin'
On my phone, she callin'
On my phone, she callin'

I'm still on the front line
Gotta get it one time
Double-crossin' both sides

Sometimes I can't keep the ghosts out
I gotta disinfect, I'm gone in a sec
You hit my phone about some money, we can reconnect
I'm with the Drain Gang, bitch, gonna drain your neck
You must've thought that I was playing, but who told you that?

What is the fuckin' meaning? Someone tell me that
I'm bladerunning in Miami with two hundred racks

I'm out in public with my razor and my Jason mask
Got twenty floors beneath me but I'm with the rats
I'm burnin' through the money 'cause I know I'll get it back
Margiela veil, opiates for sale
Drugs under my nails, get my money through the mail
I wanna know, where do you go?
Still in search of sunshine, going to the coast
Still in search of sunshine
I'm still on the front line
Gotta get it one time
Double-crossin' both sides

Thaiboy Goon tell 'em what they didn't know
Riding through the city, drop top on the low
GTB let's go
Money on my grave, hundreds on my shades
I don't wanna stay, if you got it I can pay
Something in the way, real depression I don't play
Everything decayed, I'd give everything away
Everyday the same, everyday could be today
Want to go away, I get higher like my age
Love is like a game that I don't know how to play
If you see me in the streets I don't want to show my face
Want to show you that I'm not worthless
I have taught myself how to suppress my urges
Just a basic shirt but I know it's from Hermes
Self-hatred because I need to be perfectI'm in your area, Area 51
She wanna have some fun, I tell her "Come along"
I go to Rainworld with your girl, but I'm alone
I disappear into the darkness and I'm gone
I'm in your area, Area 51
She wanna have some fun, I tell her "Come along"

She wanna have some fun, I tell her "Come along"
I go to Rainworld with your girl, but I'm alone
I disappear into the darkness and I'm gone
Cutting through a reign now, I'm flying from my war
Thaiboy, I can't take it anymore
Never go poor, all this money, I ignore
Thaiboy, I'm the one to go for
Please, don't be too late, you won't find me anymore
Please, celebrate me, one day, I'll be gone
Thaiboy Goon you know, I've been Thaiboy all along
Started at 15, now I'm almost 21
This is what I want, this is all I want
All these broke boy, they want me to fall
Young Thaiboy never fall, AvP we always ball
Fuck these hating madmen, I will get it all
Let them haters know, call us for a show
We turn up round the globe, fucking up the globe
Miss the winter snow, I wonder if it's cold
I know that she be alone, but you know Thaiboy have to go
I'm in your area, Area 51
She wanna have some fun, I tell her "Come along"
I go to Rainworld with your girl, but I'm alone
I disappear into the darkness and I'm gone
I'm in your area, Area 51
She wanna have some fun, I tell her "Come along"
I go to Rainworld with your girl, but I'm alone
I disappear into the darkness and I'm gone
I play my cards, I play with hearts
You play hard to get, that won't get you far
I don't care at all about anything at all
I'm a star, you can catch me when I fall
Catch me at the mall, Margielas when I walk
Money coming in on different credit cards
If you wanna talk, tell me where you wanna start
Smoking in the park, moving only after dark
I'm in your area, Area 51
She wanna have some fun, I tell her "Come along"
I go to Rainworld with your girl, but I'm alone
I disappear into the darkness and I'm gone
I'm in your area, Area 51
She wanna have some fun, I tell her "Come along"

You in mind but won't remember in twenty one seconds
Forget it, tell me the truth, don't lie to me
You in mind but won't remember in twenty one seconds
Had to save the date, what a day
We don't know what to say anyway
Flip up on the way, went away
You in mind but won't remember in twenty one seconds
I got away but I will wait again
Nah, nah, nah, no more surprises

Who's gonna die? 20 seconds, I'm outta sight
Who wants to get high? I got nothing to do tonight
Gotta come to your house, something in the air tonight
Going to the sky, smoking poison all the time
They hit me up online but I can't talk to them all the time
Creeping up with the Drain Gang, looking for me, I'm blind
Come save me some time, see my angels coming down

I got bruises on my neck and I got some evil friends
Got pollution in my chest, still infected in the head
Famous ghost, I'm still possessed, I feel like the God of stress
Still awake, I never rest, oh my god, I feel so blessed
True Religions, so distressed, and I'm bleeding from my lids
Ziplock full of triple X, off a blue Mercedes-Benz
Open flash got no defense, touch 15 and 1 for 10
And I wish I could forget, tell myself never againOui

Been waiting for so long
All along I was making songs
Thought that I would make it out
Up until now
I might have one chance but I don't know how
This the last dance at the final hour
Want to count the stacks every hour
Want to make it rain money shower
Got my lesson learned what I deserve, Thaiboy
Want to fight so bad, Thaiboy
I can not put it in words
All I ever had
Thaiboy I have only love
I have only love
I just want to do what I decide, Thaiboy never lie
Think of you, baby day by night
That shit all the time
Thaiboy goon I'm as a youngin' they want me to die
They wish that Thaiboy would give up

Push me down and I go up like twice so high
